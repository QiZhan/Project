" Long time no see. Like always I was rewriting it from scratch a couple of times. But nevertheless it's still java and now it uses metropolis sampling to help that poor path tracing converge.

Btw. I did MLT on yesterday evening after 2 beers (it had to be Ballmer peak).

Altough the implementation is still very fresh it easily outperforms standard path tracing, what is to be seen especially when difficult caustics are involved.

I've implemented spectral rendering too, it was very easy actually, cause all computations on wavelengths are linear just like rgb. But then I realised that even if it does feel more physically correct to do so, whats the point? 3d applications are operating in rgb color space, and because I cant represent a rgb color as spectrum interchangeably I have to approximate it, so as long as I'm not running a physical simulation or something I don't see the benefits (please correct me if I'm wrong), thus I abandoned that."

" Guest Demo: Eric Iverson’s Itty Bitty Search
February 16th, 2010 by Daniel Tunkelang
Respond

I’m back from vacation, and still digging my way out of everything that’s piled up while I’ve been offline.

While I catch up, I thought I’d share with you a demo that Eric Iverson was gracious enough to share with me. It uses Yahoo! BOSS to support an exploratory search experience on top of a general web search engine.

When you perform a query, the application retrieves a set of related term candidates using Yahoo’s key terms API. It then scores each term by dividing its occurrence count within the result set by its global occurrence count–a relevance measure similar to one my former colleagues and I used at Endeca in enterprise contexts.

You can try out the demo yourself at http://www.ittybittysearch.com/. While it has rough edges, it produces nice results–especially considering the simplicity of the approach.

Here’s an example of how I used the application to explore and learn something new. I started with [""information retrieval""]. I noticed “interactive information retrieval” as a top term, so I used it to refine. Most of the refinement suggestions looked familiar to me–but an unfamiliar name caught my attention: “Anton Leuski”. Following my curiosity, I refined again. Looking at the results, I immediately saw that Leuski had done work on evaluating document clustering for interactive information retrieval. Further exploration made it clear this is someone whose work I should get to know–check out his home page!

I can’t promise that you’ll have as productive an experience as I did, but I encourage you to try Eric’s demo. It’s simple examples like these that remind me of the value of pursuing HCIR for the open web.

Speaking of which, HCIR 2010 is in the works. We’ll flesh out the details over the next weeks, and of course I’ll share them here."

"Who moved my Cheese???   The world has been developing in and out in all the areas and to create a difference in this competitive world... we need to change...
change the way we take our things...
but we rather change or atleast try to change..... we try the same routine work evryday and expect to get more
and when things fail such as losing a job, loss in business we would upset, discouraged, frustrated and keep on hanging to the same thing again and start complaining.
CHANGE IS GOOD.... LETS WELCOME IT..!!!
wondering wat is all about Cheese?? and what actually is all about "" Who Moved My Cheese??? ""


Well...!!!! Who moved my cheese?? is a simple parable that reveals profound thoughts. It is an enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy. The story is about two mice called ""SNIFF"" and ""SCURRY"" and two little men ... smaller in size and who were similar to us people. Their names were ""HEM"" and ""HAW""

Cheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life - whether it is a good job, loving relationship, money or a possession, health or spiritual peace of mind.

And the maze is where you look for what you want - the organisation you work in, or the family or community you live in.

Everyday both the mice and men spent time in the maze looking for their own special cheese. The mice had only Rodent brains while the men used their brains, filled with many beliefs. The common thing between the rodents and these men is tat every morning they went in search for the cheese.

The maze had confusing network of paths corridors and some of the chambers had delicious cheese. But there were also dark corners and blind alleys leading nowhere. It was an easy place to get lost. Those who found the way to secret chambers had to enjoy a better life.

After much of searching they found a chamber C which had an enormous amount of richest quality of Cheese.Rodents used the trial and error method by racing through the corridors. While the men used their brains and beliefs and experience.

HAVING CHEESE MADE THEM HAPPY.
Both these men and rodents enjoyed the cheese everyday almost many many days and finally one day was such tat the cheese had to run out and there isnt left anymore.
Rodents observed the minute details of cheese getting decreased day by day and they were ready for the situation and were ready for the hunt of new Cheese.
On the otherhand these men based on their beliefs wondered ""Who moved their Cheese?"". Both HEM and HAW kept waiting for the cheese at the old place. Fearing that they might get lost in the maze they didnt start to find their way to new cheese and started starving and waiting in the old place. Both of them kept Hemming and Hawing for their old Cheese. But couldnt find any and increased frustration in them. It also created FEAR in them about what might happend if they get lost in finding new cheese..!!!
They started evaluating the situation at Chamber C and waited there everyday and returned homes hungry.
THEY WERE AFRAID OF CHANGE.

Meanwhile,Rodents found out their new way and found a chamber N having more cheese than the older one.

Everytime HAW wanted to go in search for the new Cheese. HEM would stop him. But one day in utter despair to find the new Cheese HAW started for his search leaving behind his friend HEM in the old chamber. He wrote on a wall so tat his friend had something to think about...
IF YOU DONOT CHANGE, YOU CAN BECOME EXTINCT.
and HAW in order to overcome his fear of getting lost in the maze ... he reminded himself as..
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WEREN'T AFRAID?
he continued his search and found a dark alley where he could smell some nice cheese
he was afraid of what might be on the other end... and started walking towards it.
AND when he moved he felt free and rather more young than he is.

WHEN YOU MOVE BEYOND YOUR FEAR, YOU FEEL FREE.!!!
but he didnt find any cheese it had some little pieces left over near the chamber, someone had already visited the chamber and completed it. He gulped some cheese leftover and kept some for his friend in his pocket and wondered if HEM was still in chamber C

All the while throughtout his search he kept on noticing the changes in him.. and everytime he is feeling happy and on the way back to his friend HEM , HAW had been thinking of himself as..
why he hadnt moved out before to find the new cheese...??
THE QUICKER YOU LET GO , OF OLD CHEESE THE SOONER YOU FIND NEW CHEESE.
IT IS SAFER TO SEARCH IN THE MAZE THAN REMAIN IN A CHEESELESS SITUATION.
OLD BELIEFS DONOT LEAD YOU TO NEW CHEESE.
HAW came back to his friend HEW and told his experience expecting him to turn out for searching. but HEW didnt.
so he left him there and returned for his new treasure. before coming he told him about the way he felt and shared the cheese wid him.
HAW started his journey back to the maze.

WHEN YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN FIND AND ENJOY NEW CHEESE, YOU CHANGE COURSE.
NOTICING SMALL CHANGES EARLY HELPS YOU ADAPT TO BIGGER CHANGES THAT ARE TO COME.
finally haw saw a bigger chamber wid all the variety of cheese wid enormous quantity and was happy to find the rodents der enjoying the cheese. but this time haw was ready for the change observing the minute changes so tat he could act fast.

As days passed one fine day he heard the footsteps and guessed it was HEW and was happy finally he started searching for the new cheese..!!!

(HAW could have gone to HEW and say about the new cheese at the chamber N. but he didnt since one cannot infuse the seeds to overcome the fear and accept the change . it should be from inself)

so evryone out der.... let us
ANTICIPATE CHANGE
ADAPT TO CHANGE QUICKLY
ENJOY THE CHANGE
BE READY TO CHANGE QUICKLY,AGAIN AND AGAIN

So who you are ??? SCURRY SNIFFY HEM OR HAW ??
Accepting changes like Scurry and Sniffy
or else learning about the advantages of accepting changes
or else hanging with the question... "" who moved my cheese??""

ALL THE BEST.... :)"

" Yesterday I attended a biweekly meeting of an informal a UC Berkeley group devoted to Python in science (Py4Science), organized by Fernando Perez. The format (in honor of my visit) was a series of 4-minute lightning talks about various projects using Python in the scientific world (at Berkeley and elsewhere) followed by an hourlong Q&A session. This meant I didn't have to do a presentation and still got to interact with the audience for an hour -- my ideal format.

I was blown away by the wide variety of Python use for scientific work. It looks like Python (with extensions like numpy) is becoming a standard tool for many sciences that need to process large amounts of data, from neuroimaging to astronomy.

Here is a list of the topics presented (though not in the order presented). All these describing Python software; I've added names and affiliations insofar I managed to get them. (Thanks to Jarrod Millman for providing me with a complete list.) Most projects are easily found by Googling for them, so I have not included hyperlinks except in some cases where the slides emphasized them. (See also the blog comments.)"

" Liam is nothing like Natalie. Natalie never went through draws or cabinets. She was always so good. LIAM is a bit more adventurous. And he always picks the cabinets that are the hardest to put back together. Hubby just started Nutrisystem and he has his own little section of the kitchen. Well, Liam doesn't like the order of it all and trashes my set up at least 10 times a day. YES, I need to buy one of those locks for the doors. We have one for the chemicals. But none on the food. My mistake for SURE!

In the meantime, I better document it because before I know it this boy will be in college and I will be missing cleaning up after him.
Yeah.. that's not me. But I still decided that I wanted to start doing Yoga. I've been thinking about it for quite some time. So, this weekend I bought a pair of work out shorts and a tank and off I went. The only class that was close to me was Birkham Yoga, the hot one. The 100 degree sweaty room one.

I. Almost. Died. 

The Yoga itself was wonderful. I will continue that for sure. But the HEAT of that room was unbearable. The best part is, the teacher specifically came up to me and said,"

In the EU we have browser choice, but few know about it  The EU has been tougher on monopolies than the American antitrust authorities. This has been good for Europe and bad for America. In Europe we have an amazing choice of fixed line internet providers for example. In the USA, there is generally one DSL provider and one Cable provider per territory. As a result, we have more bandwidth for less money. This is surprising because, in general, there is more choice at a better price for a lot of goods and services in the USA, including cars, banking and financial services, gadgets, etc. But the problem with the USA is that sometimes lobbying is more influential than the common good. In Europe, our career public servants seem to be less immune to lobbying (although not always, and banking, for example, seems to be an exception and most countries protect their local banks).  But recently, the EU has given us more choice in Europe. This time is the freedom to choose our browser. But as this survey shows most Europeans, around three quarters of them, are not aware of this choice. It turns out that Spain is the country with the lowest browser choice awareness in Europe.

"Hmmm.. I really didn't wanna update my blog till my results were out. But Figured I might as well blog about something I've been wanting to for quite a while. But before i begin- heres wishin u a happy new year! I was waiting for a bus and Getting pretty restless, I started twirling my cellphone between my thumb and middle finger. I almost dropped my cellphone in shock as I heard a voice to my right yell, ""o*** dei! Cellphone vechirundha periya m***** nee?""  Completely nonplussed, I turned around to see a pretty decently dressed chap on a bike looking straight at me with a furious look on his face. I didn't quite get it. The person standing in front of me seemed startled too. Guess he felt the guy was looking at him. That only confused me further. I couldn't quite make out who he was staring at! (Random note to self: Fury adds a squint to ur eye!!)
  The-guy-in-front-of-me, let's jus call him X for my aching fingers' sake(!), was visibly offended. ""Excuse me?"" he said, his voice quavering lightly. He seemed guarded and didn't turn around to face the Biker dude (gotta make do with this name for the time being!) straight on. But nothing in the world could have prepared me for what followed next. My jaw almost hit the floor in bewilderment when the Biker dude retorted, ""Enna da English-la peela vudarae? English-la pesina nee periya p******-ya?""  I could feel every eye in the bus stop trained on the three of us. What was happening? Why was he picking up a fight for no reason? And all of a sudden, a silly thought crossed my mind. Silly, but every inch possible. Was this some show like Candid Camera or MTV Bakra? Did I actually have a camera zooming in on me? Am I on TV?!? I absently ran my fingers through my hair. I was feeling extremely self-conscious! I just wanted to get the hell outta the place! (Random notes of enlightenment: My brain goes off into tangents in the opposite direction just when I want it to stay focussed.)  Perhaps Mr. X was too numb with shock to have such crazy ideas floating around in his head. he Biker dude wasn't done with the expletives. He mouthed yet another string of well-chosen obscenities. Even passers-by stopped to gawk at the scene. I really wanted to get outta that place!!  Mr.X had had enough. He spluttered in indignation, pulled himself up to full height and started to approach the Biker dude. Aaah, now this was gonna get interesting! :)  But things took yet another crazy twist as the manic look on the Biker dude's face flickered off. To be replaced by a slight hint of confusion. And then, full-blooded horror!  Mr. X seemed puzzled at the reaction too. Things fell into place when the Biker dude slapped his forehead and exclaimed ""phone-a vei da naaye. unaala en maaname pochu!"".  And even as he revved up his bike, and fled the scene, face red with embarassment, I caught a glimpse of the ear-piece of his Hands-free mobile set peep out from under his collar! :)"

"We watch movies. And we see what the camera intends to show us. Other things remaining stable, it is sometimes the camera that provides the movement. So is the case with the human eye. When I chose to isolate myself from the plethora of activities happening around, from the mundane action that surrounds me each day, there was a mild discovery I made. Ironically, irrespective of their mildness, these discoveries make me feel stronger every time they happen to me.  Getting back to the discovery I was talking about: I used my eyes as the video camera. I saw the panning, tilting, dollying and trollying movements as I strolled across my house. I noticed that the objects around me were stable only till my eyes cooperated, any non cooperation on their part brought about a movement in the world around me. And the secret that hit me was: stability is a state of the human eye, which responds to any stimulus provided by the ‘thoughting’ of the human brain.


Then, must I always complain about the changing surroundings! The environment, thoughts, people, situations: they are often a part of the thoughts that stimulate my mind."

"Cooking!  May be the title of the blog is a give away - I love cooking. Even though I am not very frequently doing so I love the act of conjuring mouth watering, aromatic delicacies :)
I love chopping onions and chillies with the precision of millimeters (only if you have the right knife and technique) and the adventure of flash frying. I have spent a good part of my telly watching years savouring exotic dishes being made 'too simple to believe' from all over the world. 

All that and more for my love of cooking later. 

What made me write this post was the fact whenever I am struggling with high pressure studies my mind tend to wander away to recipes for those after assignment parties (fictional of course!).

I am in midst of writing a very crucial piece of my dissertation and thinking about shahi toasts (deep fried bread dipped in fragrant sugar syrup) and sewaiya (vermicilli in sweet milk) :) Some day I will post if I get to make any of these..for now I should go back to the dissertation. 

PS: I do cook occasional special dishes, strangely never thought of blogging about it. May be I can post some pics soon :)"

"The jhhhhaaakkkaaaasss DSN...Do It Now !!!  We all have personal barriers, old habits, or inhibitions that hold us back and keep us from fully participating in life. DSN Course is a rigorous and transformational course, designed by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Dropping whatever does not serve your best interests is a completely liberating experience—it makes you so strong that nothing in this world can shake you.  When you are ready for true liberation, true freedom and personal empowerment, then you are ready for the power of DSN!

Last week I did DSN course for the second time and believe me,it was a life transforming experience. The dynamic,energetic teacher reaching out to every participant,bringing joy and enthusiasm to all was really min blowing....or should i say, JHHHAKKKKAS !!!! Yeah,you guessed it right...the teacher was none other than Anand Rajenderan...he had promised that all the sheep joining the course will go back as lions by the end of three days...and so it happened !!!

The padmsadhna sessions,meditations,Om namo shivay chantings....it was so blissful....and what we looked forward to the most was knowledge sessions by Anandji.Guruji's teachings were explained in such fun-filled manner and the best part used to be when Anandji used to point out the 'Pappus' from the crowd and they had to stand before the crowd till the time they started participating whole-heartedly.

The processes were amazing as usual.We had so much fun when guys were dressed like gals and vice-versa.Bhanu and me had so much fun eve-teasing...at the end of the process,all the men vowed that they will never ever tease a woman again :) Criticism process was an eye-opener in so many ways.Every process taught something new and helped in connecting with others as if they were my own.

The charisma of Anandji was witnessed in full throttle on the last day.Everyone was so over-whelmed by the Guru stories he told.That day i learnt the importance of 'giving'.Donations were raised for constructing a temple of knowldge in our city beautiful.Our dsn group raised almost 20 lakhs.there were tears of gratitude in everyone's eyes.till date we'd been living for ourselves but that day we realised what satisfaction one gets when we do something for the society we live in.

The course ended with a rocking satsang...we danced nonstop to the beats of the dhol....followed by rocking bhajans...and the award of the best dancer goes to...Anandji again...who set the floor on fire by his energetic dance.he danced with each and every participant and everyone was so excited to geta chance to shake a leg with their jhakkas teacher.

So, ladies and gentlemen – if there is a DSN course with Anandji nearby you, it is a must attend course. Do it to make a difference in your lives, in your families’ lives and for making the world a more positive and spiritual place!!"

"Rush of imagination !  Raman Varman tried to cross a check-post that he crossed daily while going to his office. But he was stopped by a security personnel who said, “Sir, Indians are not supposed to enter through this way. You may take the next turn instead.”
“What do you mean Indians can’t enter. This is India. And it’s a silly check-post and not an international border !”
“You are wrong sir. Do you see that statue there ?”, he said pointing to a far white statue that was crowned and had a torch in its right raised hand.
“You are trying to enter America sir. And you know that the law...”
“Whhhhaaattt...oooo...wow...aaahhaaa...” Raman’s involuntary expressions rose from wonderment to more wonderment before the security-man knocked at the window glass of his car, “You are obstructing the traffic sir!”

Raman woke up in the midnight. He smiled, switched on the light, took his note book and drew a rough sketch of what he saw in the dream, closed the note book, switched off the light, smiled again, and slept.

Raman was a medical representative (MR) and had quit 3 firms earlier all on the same unique ground that MRs should be respected by the company coz they are most crucial in making a deal with docs n hospitals. Al Toro Pharma was his current place of work.

He saw weird things in his dreams and painted the same ASAP before the prints of the imagination became too dull to be transferred to the canvas. One day he dreamt the Qatub Minar just adjacent to Taj Mahal. He was happy to bring entirely 2 rules separated by 300 years too close. He had dreamt the water of Ganga going up the hills. He had rented a hall every inch of which was full of deep non-sense that had originated in his mind in the past. The paintings sell for handsome amount, and Raman soon became a known image in the locality, and quite unlike the SENSEX, the radius of his popularity was on an increase.

He was uni-directionally paranoid the direction being that of his wife from where apart from the routine curses one day came a rotating a screwdriver that just missed Raman’s eyes! Yet he loved her very much coz except few hours in the day she too loved him.
His position in Al Toro became odd when he bought a Volkswagen- a machine that only earned envy for Raman. They say that you can’t but fall prey to the arrows of envy. And Raman was no exception. He decided to quit Al Toro, and establish himself as a full-time painter – a decision not in conformity with his wife’s opinion.

Being a full time painter of weirdness he would force himself to imagine insanities. He begins to avert truth and the general perception of the things. He would rotate his head and try to see the inverted objects only to confuse his mind as to what the reality is. He would try to imagine ordinary objects (like his Parker pen) as an exotic piece of excellence. He would find flaws in everything he saw, and wish if they could be as per his imagination. Surprises, he began to believe, is the most important thing that can keep you away from this general monotony of life. “Surprises”, he said, “is more powerful than happiness ... it keeps you alive !”. His public behaviour has come (declined) a long way - from humour to unwanted humour to objectionable humour to darkness and pity - a behaviour that created a mix of irritation and sympathy in those who confronted him.

One day he dreamt God speaking to him. He painted it being careless about the result. “Is God weird ?”, was a question to be answered. “What Mr Raman want to say through his popular non-sense is that God is weird !”. What Raman painted was a never-before imagination. This made many sectarians ask, “Is this a Hindu God or Allah or Jesus or Buddha or... ”. The point was if it was Allah then it was the sole responsibility of that community to object, and likewise for others.
The defence from Raman was, “God is not weird! It’s his talking to me that is weird. As in many of my paintings, it’s not the absolute objects that are weird, rather it’s their actions are weird...”
But the property of the mob is – it doesn’t listen to arguments if it has once made its mind (if at all that exists anywhere)! The carnival of absurdities (his Hall) was reduced to carnival of ashes (by fundamentalists) as the last amber grew cold. The outcome – it was proved that God is not weird! He protects himself through these agents who would commit all sins, but not hear anything against something in front of which they rotate incense stick in the morning.

Raman did not go out for many days. He kept imagining and drawing on his note-book and oscillating brushes on the canvasses. His deliberate jumping into imagination became his habit, and soon his very character. It became hard for him to distinguish between a real event and a non-real. He would meet many distant people without going out at all! This was different from schizophrenia where you have a finite number of illusions playing around you. It appeared some strange case of hyper-reality, where the brain could deliberately detach itself from even the most known things.

Today he decided to go out of his house and meet his friends at Al Toro and see the Raman Hall. Luckily he found the door of his house open for the first time since many days. He rushed out. Many men asked him to stop. They chased him. But he managed to escape. “God ! The world is getting madder day by day !”, he thought.

He changed his plan, and went to see his hall first. He asked a man nearby, “Sir, there used to be a Raman Hall here. Where is that?”. “Raman Hall? There was no such tower here. This had been a community centre since I saw it for the first time in 1981.” He had misunderstood the building he thought. He came out and inquired about the Hall, but all in vain. It getting dark, he returned to his house.

He entered his house, and surprisingly found that a thick layer of dust had taken the responsibility of protecting everything. He took something from the floor, and removed the dust from some parts. Newspaper. And it showed an edifice. Wait. “I have seen this place...Oh this is where I came out from in the morning. This is my house! ” . He removed dust further and saw himself going into the edifice with some policemen. He could not make out. He cleared all dust. The news read “Raman gets relief. Acquitted on ground of strange disorder. Taken to Protege Asylum.” The body of the news was hardly legible. He was tired. He cleaned a part of the sofa and lay there before he found a dust laden portrait, the garland of which were cocooned by spider webs, on the wall. He cleaned the portrait. It was of Lalitha’s, his wife’s.

" The scenery in Library at night. That's all I managed to capture before the Flaming Lamborghini came.

Ahhh where do I begin with the Flaming Lamborghini? How about the recipe? The ingredients are a combination of blue curacao, coffee liqueur (Bailey's and Kahlua's) and erm, yeah. It doesn't sound too bad, but drinking THAT was an adventure in itself.

What happens is the blue curacao is lighted up and goes up in flames. Then they pour the blue liquid through a chute of sorts, and into a small shot of Kahlua's and Bailey's at the end. Once the coffee liqueur has flames on it's surface, you drink it through a straw, all in one gulp.

Goddamn delicious. Hur hur hur. Really, really nice because I love Bailey's. (In other circumstances that would have sounded dirty.)

It's a tour you can't BUY - It's only available through the CEO of Disney. We are being brought in through exits of rides and they are closing down stuff for us to eat in at night. They are supplying snacks and taking us into shows without having to wait on lines. It is incredible!! Oh and we can go on rides a few times - not just once. We get off and then hop right on again. People are very confused watching us!

They have this purple card that they show which is like SUPER DUPER VIP - they said it's how the celebs go through the park. I swear - it is SICK!!

"Emotionally Spastic??  Vivek was walking to go to office when he saw a spastic person walking to catch bus for his work. Everyday he had been going same road to his job. On his way there was a small uneven area and that spastic person would fumble and Vivek if there would help him through the patch. That used to happen quite often, you know it was the same spot but the spastic person would fumble anyway, Vivek used to offer help but that person used to refuse.   Maya's husband is little hot-headed. He get angry over small things and there is a fight… Fighting over small issues is common for Maya now and she is quite frustrated about her
husband's behavior..
 
what's the difference, we all have our weaknesses, some physical some emotional…
 
In fact people feel so much pity or bad about handicap people that they are more than willing to help but I don't know why same people are screaming about person who are emotionally handicap.  Maya's husband has a genetic tendency and I don't know how much we can really change our basic nature.  
 
Is there a co-relation between these 2 stories ? Emotional weakness and physical one  are they on the same level ?

Maya can't change her husband's nature but can she give him a helping hand?
 
 
There is one famous guy, who said ""Accept people as they are"". I kind of liked it…. I would stop complaining why he is failing whether in a physical or mental quality, you will feel like helping and that will solve lot of problems    
 
That spastic person or angry husband,  both are not ABLE to change but can we make other choice .. one that makes us happier …."

"Faith - The other day someone remarked that I have too much faith in my Guru. Such remarks/comments do keep flying around me all the time. However, this time it set me thinking. Do I have faith in my Guru? And if so and if not, what is 'faith'?  H H Sri Sri Ravishankar, founder of The Art Of Living says ""Faith in the divine and faith in one's faith. You know everything is being protected, and everything is being taken care of.""

Osho said ""Faith is a leap into the unknown"".

Both these conceptualizations I could agree with. After all they have been given by spiritual masters ! But conceptualizations are done merely for the benefit of intellect driven humans trying to fathom truth through their cognitive abilities. My agreeing with them or disagreeing with them does not take me any closer or any farther from truth. As truth stands beyond what I agree with or do not agree with. So, do I have faith? Faith in whom, faith in what? Do I have faith in my Guru? Do I have faith in Him? Do I feel that He is with me? I am protected? Or better still do I feel that I am with Him? Both don't seem to be absolutely true. It is neither. Where is He? Who is He? If He is there then He doesn't seem to be with me and it doesn't seem as though I am with Him. He seems so distant. Yet He is!
I stand there shorn of His proximity or distance. I am and He is! He is a part of me, an integral part of me, He is me !! Is it blasphemy to say He is me? I don't know. He is me.
I am also shorn of all protection............ protection from whom, from what. All that is there is a part of me, it is me!
Is this faith ??"

" So that wasn't so bad. Have had already 5 glasses (small) of beer and feeling supremely woozy. World was all fuzzy, glasses came off (so I don't break it) and face was hot as heck. Things were suddenly really, really niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice.

I was talking a fair bit of crap too. Can't remember what I said but judging from the delighted faces of my colleagues, it must have been awesome blackmail material.

And so there I was, singing off-key, swaying to the music (I was swaying anyway from the alcohol) and having shit-loads of fun.

Then the Black Russian came. He took the rest of me to the toilet. In a good way. (Yeah, that sounds dirty NOW.)

But make no mistake. It was DAMN tasty too. (At this point, JA kidnapped my phone to update my Twitter in a most drunken manner, IT WASN'T ME.)"

"Kunti's Ghanti
Before I start writing on this I would just like to tell everyone that am not making fun or abusing history its just seeing today's IT/Corporate world this idea struck to me.
Whatever I write in this blog its all imaginary :)

We all know how Karan was born?? OMG!! not Kyunki's but Mahabharata's Karan.Ill just give a brief recap courtesy: ""Wikipedia""

Karna was born to his mother Kunti by his father the solar deity Surya. Karna was born, before his mother's marriage to prince Pandu. When Kunti was young, the sage Durvasa visited her father's palace. She served the sage with utmost care for an entire year. Pleased by her service and hospitality, the sage foresaw her future difficulty after marriage of not having a child through Pandu, and hence granted her a boon to overcome this difficulty. By this boon she could call upon any god of her choice, and beget a child. Out of curiosity, Kunti still being unmarried, decided to test the power of the boon. She invoked the mantra and called Surya. Bounded by the power of the mantra, Surya appeared before her and granted her a son, who was as radiant and robust as Surya himself. This baby was born with an armour ('Kavacha') and a pair of earrings ('Kundala') attached to him. Though Kunti retained her virginity, she was unwilling to face the world as an unwed mother. She placed the baby Karna in a basket and set him afloat on the holy river Ganga in the hope that he would be taken in by another family.


Now lets move to my View

Imagine people working in IT industry getting such boon or power.Oh life would become so easy or i should say mantr(a)i :) i.e if IT people have mantra called Kunti's Ghanti then it would be so cool...

Guy working in IT industry is so happy to say my office timings are 8 to 5 so I get evenings.Is it true??Yes very much for few months atleast.Then he has to be isolated ""Main aur mera Manager types"".His friends start shouting at him on not coming to any trips,function,get together etc.
His gf/wife is like tell me if you are going to come for dinner then only ill think of making something; but think of it is it possible to inform at 6:30 in the evening that ill be home by 8:00??? No its not.Server might crash at 7:45 usually when cab is ready to pick you or at 7:40 your manager might ping you ""Hey did u get time to look into this""??? If this continues how would people have family life?? Forget about life family atleast ?? :P
The other day I saw a kid in my society may be 5-6 year old kid his grandpa like came and took him for a ride I was surprised seeing grandpa taking a kid on a drive n all usually we see kid holding grandpa's hand and going to nana-nani park or a walk,but then I came to know that he was his dad and not grandpa.Result of starting late family or loss of (grey) hair due to work n tension.

Let's see the following story

A 30 year guy get married and tells his wife see we will plan our honeymoon a month later so that I can impress my boss saying seeing the work I have postponed my honeymoon and will get 1 month leave.What a plan??? Cool !
After 3 days of marriage he goes to office and mails his manager for leave for a month.Week passes no reply,then he sends a meeting request to the manager for the same.Before manager could accept the meeting request manager calls this guy for some discussion.He tells seeing your dedication we are offering you onsite opportunity to london for 3 months initially I understand you have just got married but this also leads to your promotion so thought of having a word with you.Poor guy with a smile on his face and tears too goes back to his desk.
Then he goes home and tells this to his wife;wife under impression that she would also go to london becomes happy (which is not really going to happen).Husband with all guts tells his wife see we can plan our honeymoon soemtime later as this is a good opportunity and I am thinking of taking it .
Next day wife comes up with this Kunti's Ghanti and tells I have got this Kunti's Ghanti mantra which would help me till the time you are back :) It works the same way it worked for Kunti but this is more advanced with protection :)If i skip the protection part of that mantra there are high chances that I get pregnant; but am thinking of why not take Hrithik Roshan or Brad Pitt's name in this Mantra instead of you.
Listening to this husband faints!

Story 3:

Once a husband returns home after 3 days of work and hugs his wife and say's I think we should start a family.Wife say's oh u had time to discuss this I already applied Kunti's Ghanti a month back thinking you might not have time to even discuss this..dont worry have taken your name and waiting for the result :)

Saw how Kunti's Ghanti useful for early family planning?? :P"

"Gay rights pros and cons   we all have been listening about gay rights these days. Recently Delhi high court also agreed to make homosexual relationship as a legal act. Prior to this historic and a bit controversial decision homosexual activities were considered as criminal under section 377. But now a man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman.
Some people consider it right saying that we should not discriminate people based on their sexual habits. If some one is homosexual that is his or her choice and we should respect it. If we give their relationship a recognition in society then it will decrease the chances of unsafe sex. That will help in reducing the cases of HIV positive. Adding to that homosexual culture has gained a lot of popularity and it is not possible to keep suppressing them.
At the same time some people consider it is wrong. They say it is not our culture. It belongs to western countries and it suits them only. Some feel that it violates their religion and they are ready to do anything to stop it from spreading. Some politicians also have jumped into that thinking it may be another hot issue for vote bank. But still i feel that though many people in our country have their opinion about this issue not too many really bother about it. Specially those who are straight. So I just hope it wouldn't entertain politicians much.As far as religious feelings are concerned i will say that all the rules of all the religions were made by human beings only.So we can change them according to the need of hour.
Now we have seen some people favour homosexuality while some oppose it. I kind a have mix opinion about it. Well if someone is not straight then I don't think he or she should be left out of the society it will only make things worse and yes at the end of the day its their life and they have right to decide which way they gonna live it. Straight or Gay (lesbian). I guess most of the youngster like me will be thinking the same way and they really don't mind homosexuality being legal.
But but but.............
There is something that can be really bothering. I guess first time I heard about this gay thing from some of my friend i was in 10th or 11th standard and my first reaction was how can it be possible. How can a boy love a boy or how can a girl fall with another girl. I thought he was kidding. Only after some time i figured out he was right. Well for most of us we heard about the homosexuality things a bit too late and by that time it was very difficult to think about loving same sex person. Because most of us never thought that other way round also could have been possible and by the time we came to know we were already fond of other sex. But the way it has gone and grown in India in last few years it is getting a bit dangerous. Still thinking why? well because next generation will be knowing these things from their childhood. We will find the cases of homosexuality increasing and its legalisation will make it even worse. Most of the people who are standing today for gay rights will not find it the same if their kids follow the unconventional sex(homosexuality) habits. Most of the celebrities and young people stood in favour of gays. But they will definitely not support some one of their family following the Idea.Well currently we see in some of the colleges management is very strict with boys and girls hanging around together.But what they gonna do about this whole gay(lesbian) thing?? forget about hanging around they will be in same hostel and may be sharing room as well.I guess parents too will be having nightmares.Stop the kid(boy) from going out with girls or boys. So we have tough time ahead with this gay stuff.Hope it goes fine..............."

" Chile Earthquake and Spiritual Promptings
On the LDS Church News website last week there was an article about the earthquake in Chile and how the mission there had already been preparing for an earthquake in the weeks leading up to the quake. The article is an e-mail written by Sister Lisa Laycock, wife of Chile Santiago East Mission President Larry Laycock, and originally sent to her friends and family after the quake. Here is an excerpt:


""When we were set apart for this calling, Elder [Richard G.] Scott of the [Council] of the Twelve Apostles taught us many important lessons. He spoke from personal experience when he was a mission president in Argentina. One message that he shared with us is this: 'At times, during your mission, you will be awakened in the middle of the night or the early morning hours with thoughts of specific things you should do for certain missionaries. Do not ignore these thoughts. They are promptings from the Holy Ghost who will communicate with you in the stillness of the night or the peace of the early morning hours. He will speak to you then because that is when you are still enough to hear.' Elder Scott further instructed us to keep a notebook beside our bed so that we could record these precious promptings. He said that by the next morning, we would be likely to forget the promptings if we didn't write them down.
""We have been astonished at the fulfillment of Elder Scott's prophetic words. We have received many promptings in the exact manner that Elder Scott described. We are so thankful that Elder Scott taught us how to recognize and act upon these precious promptings. Had he not taught us, we may not have given these promptings the attention they require.
""Nearly two and one half weeks [before the earthquake], I was awakened at around 4 a.m. by just such a prompting. I did not hear a voice, but the thought was as clear as if it had been in the form of spoken words: 'There is going to be an earthquake. Prepare your missionaries.' I sat up in bed and immediately remembered Elder Scott's counsel. That morning I told Larry what had happened. He immediately set to work organizing our missionaries to prepare for an earthquake.
""In talking with our office missionaries to arrange for them to put together a list of everything we would need to prepare...in both Spanish and English...we discovered that the Lord had also let two of our office missionaries know of the possibility of an earthquake (in the form of dreams) and the need to prepare our mission. We set a goal and arranged our schedule so that we could visit every apartment in the mission to check for safety and to review with our missionaries what to do in case of an earthquake. What a wonderful experience we have had as we have met with them and shared scriptures with them about being spiritually and physically prepared. '...if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear' (D&C 38:30). We instructed every missionary to have a ""go-bag"" (36 hour kit). We reviewed our emergency action plan with them of where to go and what to do if they had phone service and in case they did not. We gave everyone a paper with all instructions in English and Spanish, and we reminded them that 'this life is the time to prepare to meet God' (Alma 34:32-34). We shared with them our thoughts and feelings about the need for spiritual and physical safety. Some of them became frightened and asked us if we knew something they didn't know. We smiled and repeated '...if ye are prepared, ye shall not fear.' We didn't want to unduly alarm them, but we did want to impress upon them the need to be prepared. We tearfully reminded them of our recent transfer conference where we had shared our feelings about our dear Elder McKay Burrows who was unexpectedly called home in January while serving his mission in Romania...how he was prepared in every way to meet God. We reissued our challenge to 'be prepared' in every way. Then we knelt with them in their apartment and dedicated each apartment, asking for a blessing of safety and security to be upon every apartment.
""When the earthquake came, we were prepared. We did not experience the panic that many felt. We knew we were prepared. Because of the words of the Lord's chosen apostle, Elder Scott, we had listened and heeded the quiet, but clear promptings of the Holy Ghost. We were blessed with peace in the midst of chaos. We learned an important lesson: our preparation helped us to avoid panic and fear, but the Lord, in His wisdom, allowed us to experience enough discomfort to know that He has all power. He is in charge. We are nothing without Him. We are dependent upon Him for every breath we take. Only He can save us from death and destruction. He is the way, the truth, and the life. He is our perfect example. If we follow Him, we will be saved through obedience to the laws and ordinances of His Gospel.
""As the earthquake became more violent, the mission home groaned and wailed. The power died, so the whole city was black. The windows made a hideous screeching sound, and flying objects banged against swaying walls. The printer/fax machine, books, book ends, and fifty-pound television burst from the entertainment center and crashed to the floor, cabinets emptied, drawers flew open, the refrigerator moved, water sloshed out of the toilets, the floor jolted up and down as we ran across it trying to hold onto the walls to keep from falling down, and the piano toppled over like a small toy. As we made our way to the back yard, I remember thinking, 'God is all-powerful. He is our only refuge from this horrible mess.' I prayed and prayed for Him to still the earth. When we reached the back yard, we watched in terror. By the light of the moon we could see the swimming pool water form giant waves and crash out onto the rocks. House and car alarms screamed into the night...some from being crushed by falling debris and others I guess from the bizarre movement of the earth. I am not sure if the intense rumbling sounds came from the earth itself or from everything else that was shaking so violently. Finally, it stopped. When the calm came, we had to sit down because our legs were weak and unstable. My legs stayed wobbly all day and night yesterday. Today (Feb. 28) the muscles in my legs hurt like I ran a marathon. The aftershocks have been extremely unsettling. Each one begins like the one last night started. We just close our eyes and wait to see if it escalates or dies down. I have never experienced anything like this!""
Wow! The description of the earthquake was pretty cool to read, I don't think I would ever want to experience that myself. But the description of how the mission was already preparing for the earthquake was even more amazing. Heavenly Father really cares about us and he does provide us with spiritual promptings if we care to listen. What would have happened if this sister and the other missionaries had decided to ignore the prompting they received? I'm sure all the missionaries and their families are grateful that the three individuals who received promptings to prepare for an earthquake were in tune enough with the Holy Ghost to realize that it was a warning and take action."

"Is uncle ""SAM""behind ""TERRORISM""????  -  It is my debut in blogs and i was thinking to do it long time ago but cannot.Now I have started it ,then I thought on what thing should I start. To tell u when I was thinking about this,in front of me the times of india home page was open and some clip of respected Manmohan Singhji and Mr. Ahmad Raja Gilani was open in which they were talking to each other in NAM summit.straightaway I thought that I will write on most important and dreadful and horrifying problem we are facing (I guess more than Global Warming) and that is TERRORISM.

It has been blamed that Pakistan or other countries in central Asia have initiated Terrorism but is that true ???I do not think so...These countries are all the scapegoats..then who is the master???yes absolutely correct ..it is uncle SAM.I am just not not crapping here ,I am telling u the truth.Pakistani author Ahmad Rashid in his book states that in 1986 when Soviet Union was in war with western countries especially U.S. then the inititation of organised militancy was done.

In this book it has been stated that in 1986 U.S.'s Central Intelligence Agency(CIA), Britain's M16 and Pakistan's InterServices Agency(ISI) planned to launch mujahideen attacks in Soviet Union and most of the funding was sponsored by uncle SAM.Now the question is that why are they afraid of aftermaths of the things they have done ???you have to be brave enough to face the things you have done .Now the twin tower attacks triggered their adrenaline and they started attacking here and there creating more terrorists then stopping them.There had been excessive killing in these in 8 years andits not acceptable and its just not only about stopping terrorism.its also about playing the oil game and winning it too.really hats off to uncle SAM and I am also still suspicious that was twin tower attack really act of Terrorism or it was game played by the clever mind of uncle SAM.You never know because when they create moon on earth then it can also be done.

These things have to be thought about and or the solutions have to be sorted out otherwise towers were in their own country then it can happen to any other.I am not blaming only one country but we should be ready for stopping it...."

"the pune visit It has been really killing me. 6 months long semester is like marathon race and if you were taking mid sem exams on Saturdays and were kept on your toes on Sundays as well then you can understand what I went through. It wouldn’t be wrong if you say I was workaholic in last 7 months. So I decided to take 8 to 10 days break. And I decided to go for pune as I have always liked this place. So let’s see what happened there.
I got ticket for a direct train from trichy to pune and I decided to board in that train in spite of the fact that I would reach there sharp 2 a.m. because that was the only train that has seats available. When it reached some place called Sholapur in Karnataka or Maharashtra people started closing and bolting the doors and windows. I asked what the matter was. Someone told me that some people may come to rob the train with swords and guns. He also told that last time he traveled through this train and robbers came and robbed the train. (What the hell. That is why I got the tickets for this train. There were 4 or 5 constables also in the train with guns to protect us). But I think it was my luck so nothing happened. I spent most of my journey reading my novel or watching out of the window. (No hot chicks to check out :().
I was praying my train to be late as I was going to my sister’s home in pune and she and my jiju were to come after 12 in the noon. But they left keys for me with their neighbors. But I couldn’t have gone someone’s home at 3 a.m. in the morning to ask for the key. My train reached on time. So I thought I should rather wait on station. There is one nice restaurant on station (I don’t remember the name as usual). It is 24*7 restaurant and its kind a place where you would love to go and have something. I have never seen such restaurant on any other station. I went there to have something and pass my time. Suddenly when I was on counter I got a call from my friend. He is studying in Lonavala. Dude 2 a.m. in the morning and he is calling he must be here somewhere I thought. I picked and he was seating behind me. We had a long chat, some food and coffee. I was meeting him after 3.5 years. I guess the World is really small. He had his train at 4:30. So we chatted for 2.5 hrs. I left at 6 a.m. and reached home around 7 after struggling with auto walas.
One day I spent sleeping and rest 3 were spend in seeing the beauty of pune. Now you must be wondering what is so beautiful in pune. Yup there are no tourist spots like in some other places. But city is full of youths and things that attract youths :). I played a lot with piyush (my nephew). Last time I saw him he was not even 1 year old. This summer he will turn 3. Kids and food are hard to resist. My taste buds were happy after long time. So I played a lot with him and also ate a lot. We sindhi are known for our passion for food and clothes. I haven’t seen anyone else spending as much money on food and clothes as we do. And our food can’t be finished without dessert. So I was loaded with a lot of stuff. I also went to my cousin. He is currently working in CRL (part of tata group)in pune. That is a lab where World’s 4th and Asia’s no. 1 supercomputer is kept. He told me a lot about his work and supercomputer. Though I couldn’t go to his lab as visitors were allowed on Saturdays only and I was heading for kalyan(1 hr form Bombay) before that. We went for movie (avatar) one evening. We thought as it is a week day we will get tickets. But we couldn’t get for evening as well as night show. We went for next day morning show (8:30 a.m.). Well pune girls were quite fashionable and I didn’t miss any opportunity to check them out. 2 years back when I went to pune their shorts used to be below knees but in these 2 years they have come above knees. I don’t know where they will be in next few years (lol :D :) ). Pune was chilly in morning and nights. But still when we went for the morning 8:30 show girls came wearing shorts and sleeveless. I realized that its quite tough to be a girl in a city like pune :D. These girls were no less than fire in a chilly morning. Anyways we went for the movie. I read a review of the movie somewhere before watching it and it said “you have never seen anything like this before” and yup these words were quite true. I saw it in 3D and found it to be really awesome.
After spending 4 or 5 days I left for kalyan and spent couple of days there. I booked the window seat in the train so i could enjoy the beauty of Lonavala and Khandala. Both the places are beautiful but if you want to see its true colors you should go in rainy season. I also had plan for Bombay but couldn’t go. In kalyan again most of my time went in talking to my cousin and wandering in shops and streets. I and my cousin discussed a lot about our college lives and all the funny stuff. Couple of years ago we two were youngest in our family until some offspring came and snatched our title :(. Anyways we are still the rock star of our family I guess :). So we had good time.
All good things come to an end. So was this trip. :(. But I had good time there and put on some wait too. :(. I hope mess food will bring me back to normal size."

One of India’s six largest IT outsourcing companies. Counts such Fortune 500 companies as Sony among its customers. The biggest corporate scandal in India. More than $ 1.5bn of investors’ money dwindled thanks to one family. Rather, one man who famously said, “It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten”. Ya, right. Its my !@#$%^ money, you moron! But guess what’s new? The man is happy, leading the life of a King, though he’s still a B-class prisoner. A B-class prisoner is a habitual offender or a professional crime-doer. Someone who can harm the society in a greater way. He is expected to share his cell with another prisoner. And the well known rule, is that NO electronic gadgets are allowed inside the cell. Our Constitution happens to be the longest and our country, the biggest democracy in the world. “All Men Are Equal Before Law”, did they say?  Some equality, I tell you. A man died in custody after being brutally beaten in the Neelankarai Police Station day before yesterday. For a silly domestic issue. And here’s Mr.SmartyPants who gobbled up MY bloody money, eating a 5 course dinner.

" As a blogger of only a few weeks, I'm learning there is a certain etiquette for blogging. (I just scratched my head trying to invent a word like blogiquette, but it didn't quite work as it turns the G into a soft G.) In my surely deluded mind, I'd get hundreds of followers and comments alike, full of praise for my irreverant (am I deluded again?) style of blogging. As I said, this was in my mind. 


What I have learned is this: You won't get followers if you don't follow others. That actually sounds like a life lesson as well doesn't it? Same for comments. So I started following and commenting, and guess what, yay, I got followers and comments. This may be obviously to you lot reading this, but it wasn't to me. I'd previously been used to blogging on my own website for my 4 year old son, full of pictures of what he'd been up to. My readers were my family and friends, living too far away to see us regularly, able to catch up on the blog. But I'd not had to earn readers. I am slowly appreciating that I now have to."

" Haven't posted here for months. All sorts of reasons and, simultaneously, no reason at all. It happens or it doesn't. Many's the time I've started writing a post and it's never come to fruition. That's just the way it goes.

There've been all sorts of lovely and important cultural events since I last posted. Maybe I'll get round to talking about them, maybe I won't.

I'm not long back, this evening, from a standard (I'm thinking of it as equivalent to Classic Coke) Duckie in terms of both Readers Wifes being present and correct. Amazing music, played in just the right order, some of it having gradually accreted danceable fabulousness over time (MGMT's Kids) and a good dollop of old favourite loveliness.

Amy commented on there being a ""Back To School"" vibe and, although my own work is constant through spring, summer, autumn and winter, I can see where she's coming from. "

"Buddha, one day, was on deep thought about the worldly activities and theways of instilling goodness in human.The following is the text of conversation between him and his disciple  One of his disciples approached him and said humbly "" Oh my teacher ! While you are so much concerned about the world and others, why don't you look into the welfare and needs of your own disciples also.""
Buddha : ""OK.. Tell me how I can help you?""
Disciple : ""Master! My attire is worn out and is beyond the decency to wearthe same. Can I get a new one, please.""
Buddha found the robe indeed was in a bad condition which needed replacement. He asked the store keeper to give the disciple a new robe towear on. The disciple thanked Buddha and retired to his room.
Though he met his disciple's requirement, Buddha was not all that contended on hisdecision. He realized he missed out some point. A while after, he realized what he should have asked the disciple.

He went to his disciple's place and asked him ""Is your new attirecomfortable? Do you need anything more ?""
Disciple : ""Thank you my Master. The attire is indeed very comfortable. I need nothing more""
Buddha : ""Having got the new one, what did you do with your old attire?""
Disciple : ""I am using it as my bed spread""
Buddha ""Then.. hope you have disposed off your old bed spread""
Disciple "" No.. no.. master. I am using my old bedspread as my window curtain""
Buddha "" What about your old Curtain?""
Disciple ""Being used to handle hot utensils in the kitchen""
Buddha : ""Oh.. I see.. Can you tell me what did they do with the old cloth they used in Kitchen""
Disciple : ""They are being used to wash the floor.""
Buddha ""Then, what about the old rug being used to wash the floor...???""
Disciple ""Master, since they were torn off so much, we could not find any better use, but to use as a twig in the oil lamp, which is right now lit inyour study room....""

BUDDHA SMILED IN CONTENTMENT AND LEFT FOR HIS ROOM.

We all are blessed to have a living example in our life in physical form.

Hot,hotter and hottest Chennai has finally turned into a better place.Thanks to the showers! But despite the rare downpours in Chennai, a few people still despise the rain. I’ve always wondered why people don’t like the rain. Rain enlivens the lifeless earth, gives a fresh look to the otherwise dry leaves, ensures a free supply of  ‘water-the elixir of life’ throughout the year and above all isn’t it beautiful ? Rain has served as an inspiration for many poets independent of the language in which they write. Rain songs have become a part and parcel of every movie just like the item numbers.And, invariably the Rain song is a definite hit! Not just a hit, most rain songs are beautiful too.Is it just the music that brings the beauty ? Definitely not.. Its the rain itself which adds beauty to the song.The rhythm of the rain drops falling, the crystal showers filling the place, the beautiful heroine dancing in the rain.. (does she dance to the song or to the rhythm of the rain ?? .. I’ve always wondered! ) Isn’t it magical ?

" Seems my sRGB conversion was causing that fireflies from previous images.

Btw. I was wondering why the farthest I've ever get in ray tracing (excluding fixed path MLT in C++) was when I was using OCaml. Say what You want, but that functional language thing fitted ray tracing very well. Also, but that's maybe caused by my nature - now when I have dozens of ways to implement something I start to wonder what way to choose, what would lead to better design. Too many options confuse me, and slow me down big time."

" When I look back at who I was and how green and naive I was when I entered seminary and first approached the ordination process in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts, I am astonished that I made it through the selection process. I believe it was only because the Church's discernment process at that time was rather loose and lacking in rigor (and also rather still functioning as the ""old boys' network"" now having to figure out what to do with women).

There was still plenty of confusion, mixed messages, and what might, at least in retrospect, seem like warning signals that I did my best to ignore.

The discernment committee suggested that I do a year's internship in a church (five years in a non-church job might have been more appropriate!), because, they judged, that I was ""too sweet and inexperience, at least in appearance"". While the bishop in charge of the ordination process told me to ""go on being your own sweet self""!"

In both of the shows, the main character is portrayed as an ordinary person who is so much passionate about playing football.They at the beginning do not have that much skill in playing football but the unending passion which they have in their hearts make them play with so much talent that people think it its an inborn talent in them. I too am a normal person. Well, a little big for my age, not having that much stamina or any sorta skill in football. So its no great thing that I was but a defender when we played for fun at school. Seeing those 2 shows, for some reason, made me grow really passionate about that gr8 game. It made me think that I too want to be a player, have fun on the field, hit goals and what not! How I want to play in the International Field with the players like Ballack,Ronaldo,Ronaldinho,Robben and so many others.Well If not with them at least against them :) How I wish I could score against great goalies like lehmann and Buffon.

" When shooting outside at or around twilight, it’s pretty important to know where the sun’s going to go down (or where it’s going to come up). It’s easy enough to look up sunrise/sunset times, but the sunset/rise moves across the horizon throughout the year.

This took some digging to find, but it’s actually very easy to figure this out. You’ll need:

This link to the NOAA Solar Calculator
A compass, which you can get pretty much anywhere.
Then do this:

Find your location (the location where you’ll be at sunse) on the map in that link
Enter the date you’re interested in
Note the sunset time. Under “AZ/EI” you’re getting a degree measurement, which is what we need eventually; but it’s actually showing the current azimuth instead of the azimuth at sunset.
Enter the sunset time in the time fields next to the date fields. The AZ/EI field will update. That’s the number you’ll need.
The number you’ve just found should be a degree measurement, between 0 and 360. This is the solar azimuth angle at sunset. Generically, an azimuth is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system. The solar azimuth is calculated (by the application at that link, anyway) as the number of degrees clockwise from true north that corresponds to the position on the horizon that the sun is directly above. If that seems confusing, it’s because it is. On the bright side: it’s really easy to work with when you get to where you want to shoot:

When you get to your location, take out your trusty compass and:

Align the compass with magnetic north
Find the degree measurement on the compass that matches the number you got earler
That direction is pointing toward where the sun will go down.

There’s definitely a margin of error here. First, this doesn’t account for topography getting in the way (if you’re next to a mountain, the sun will go behind it long before it’s “down”, so the angle will be off). Second, the compass is reading magnetic north instead of due north, and the reported azimuth is measured from due north. But: it’s free, it’s pretty easy, and for my purposes, it’s good enough."

"EU Commissioner alive on video  Do you, like me, sometimes feel that the EU is a faceless colossus with innumerable bureaucrats that you have no idea what they are up to?  Well, some commissioners have now understood the power of online video. Just check out this weekly video from the EU Commissioner Viviane Reding.  “I want all Europeans to be able to switch their phone operator â€“ whether mobile or fixed â€“ within one single day” A worthy cause indeed!

Here you see a very human EU Commissioner and you feel her enthusiasm and drive for the issue she is presenting. The video is simple, but professionally done, she is reading well from a teleprompter.

What a difference compared to just reading her press release!
Why are not more leaders using online video like this?

So I think this way of communication is exemplary, but there are someÂ  things that can be improved:

The video player should have an indication on how long the video is. This is essential, I want to know if I have the time or not available.
The video player should have an embed-button, so that it is easy to embed the video in blogs and other web sites. This creates viral spreading.
The text of her speech is downloadable as a PDF with a link next to the video. It would have been better to be able to read the text beside the video. Ideally the text should be navigable so that you can click on it to make the video jump to that part, like New York Times is doing.
There should be an RSS feed so that I can subscribe to these videos in my RSS reader.
It would have been nice to enable some form of viewer interaction. For example, have a poll about the issue mentioned, or allow comments to the video.
What do you think? Please comment!

Update April 3: I just received an email from an assistant to Ms Reding, thanking me for my email where I praised her for using video like this. I had not expected any reply, except maybe a short standard email response. So I was surprised to see that the email contained this image of a scanned letter: "

" DELIVERABLES VS. DELIVERY 
Wireframes, flow diagrams, personas, card sorts, content strategy documents, etc. All of these things are important to design, and designers need some combination of them to synthesize their user research and communicate what they’re doing with the other members of the team.

But too often these deliverables are the last line of contact for designers. Too often these deliverables are what designers prepare and then hand off to implementors. Then they shuffle off to create more deliverables and the cycle is repeated.

In the end deliverables are merely artifacts of the design process. They are not the final design, they are not the artifact of experience. The end user never interacts with them…they interact with the product or service that is actually delivered.

That’s the difference: deliverables are divorced from delivery.

Thus, the task of a UX designer, in order to stay true to our calling, doesn’t stop at any deliverable. Even if our “job” is to create wireframes, we cannot be satisfied with passing off wireframes to other team members. If we are truly concerned with the experience of the people who use our product/service, we will infiltrate their world…we will demand to know the quality of their experience.

Many UX designers are judged on the quality of their deliverables. This is necessary to a point, we must make sure each step is faithfully executed. But to truly be a user experience designer, we must have a longer scope. We can’t stop at deliverables. We must extend through delivery.

Deliverables are diminishing in importance. Sketches, super important to early design synthesis, have fleeting value. They are valuable for a very short period of time. Design, implement, iterate, move on. Record the learning, but don’t judge the sketch, judge the resulting experience.

So, if you’re not involved in the day to day feedback loop of your user’s experience, make sure you get involved. Ask about your feedback channels: support emails, call-center requests, twitter mentions, all of it. Do regular surveys and user testing. Investigate. Demand data. If you don’t, you’re just creating deliverables and missing the forest for the trees.

Experience, in the end, cannot be captured in a deliverable."

My youngest brother does not have much of a memory for directions and maps. While this leads to some friendly jibes about his lack of that so-called "manly" trait of the compass in the head, so to speak, it led to me to think about this whole notion of "necessary skills". So when I can look up directions on Google maps from my mobile phone, or have an in-car GPS system give me directions turn by turn and even notify me of traffic conditions, is a sense of physical direction an important skill any more?  I look back and realize that technology trends tend to define what skills are "in" or "out". I have forgotten the art of memorizing phone numbers, because we know share contacts through bluetooth, text messages and missed calls. Come to think of it, I have also lost the unique Indian skill of being able to buy a black ticket at a crowded cinema when the box office tells you that the tickets are sold out. That's because I buy my tickets and choose my seats online now. A few years back, I was part of a technical interview panel for my company, grilling some poor people on the basics of C++ and Java. And since I do not enjoy making people squirm, I left with a very bad taste. I decided then that it made no sense to ask somebody the "difference between overloading and overriding". If I was asked a question like that at a job interview, I would pull out a laptop, connect to the internet and show the interviewer the answer that I pulled up from Google. I fail to see why Indian IT services firms still continue to test people for their ability to memorize Kernighan and Ritchie's memorable tome. Memorization is a skill that's most definitely "out". Information is freely available and searchable. So let's stop testing for information and start testing for knowledge.

The other day a random thought crossed my mind while scanning through some photos of a friend…When was the last time i opened a album ? (i mean the paperback ones) God,it’s been so long ago..I can’t even remember now..Digital camera’s just spoilt us crazy..  I remember when we would just click pictures with our Minolta camera and wait desperately to receive the photos from the studio just to see how they turned out…That excitement is dead now..No curiosity ..nothing   Forget the inquisitiveness,that is an attribute long dead anyway…but the fact that you can sit on your favourite chair with a photo album and a cup of tea to remember the funny and happy times on a rainy evening..is just priceless…  I am not against digital camera’s…I love them! But the feeling when you can open  an album and reminisce is extraordinary…   Now for the smart ones out there..yeah yeah..just print the photo out…(i know that!) …but really how many of us do that? we just keep gaping at the photos on our laptops …!!!   I miss having pictures adorning my wall!  Pictures of you…and me

"A Billion IDIOTS!! - Before I went to see 3 Idiots , I had heard a thousand people chant about the brilliance of the movie. So , amidst all the hosannahs and eulogies that i heard chanted about the film , all the frenzied applause by everyone whenever the name of the movie was mentioned , I went to see the film at last. And did 3 Idiots live up to my expectations...??

As a movie... YES. A perfectly made , celluloid entertainer. Every performance was exceptional for its sheer energy and versatality. So , As a cinematic adventure , Hirani and Amir hold the story together perfectly.

But , 3 IDIOTS , for all its fine comic moments , is a very dangerous film. The movie legitamizes a scorn and hatred of education. It ridicules the best education institutions set in INDIA , sanctions wilful dumbing of our own. It shows our higher education system as an arena of bad teachers determined to ruin the student's lives , suicidally pressurizing students.

Amazingly , a film whose central message is ""the education system sucks"", "" we earn nothing at our centers of excellence"" , ""dont study hard jusst do what pleases you"" is being hailed as the best film ever made in INDAIN CINEMA. This huge popularity of the movie shows how eager we are to embrace mindlessness and how keen we are to see education and hard work as obstacles to enjoying a good life.

We keep chanting the mantra ""the-system-sucks , who-cares-about-grades , the-rat-race-is-foolish."". Yes our education system needs reforms , things need to improve but in the pusuit of educational reforms , we cannot allow standards of excellence be lowered. The IIT's must be applauded for the world-class minds they've thrown up , they are institutions that are respected all over the world.

There was a scene in the film in which Rancho mocks the Laplace Transforms (the equation written on the blackcoard) as an example of rote learning. Yet, without Laplace Transforms , Hirani's computer would not boot up!! As an Engineering student, I have never come across a teacher like VIRUS nor have i ever felt the manic stress during the 3 years of my college life.

Let's get real about higher education , and not engage in an escapist fantasy and convince ourselves that education doesnot matter. For each of us, geniuses or not ... there are no short cuts.

So , THREE IDIOTS IS A GREAT MOVIE!! BUT THAT'S JUST IT ... IT'S NO MORE THAN A STORY."

Yes, there’s a pattern in the plots of all his books. But that’s how it is for 90% of writers across the globe. The bad ones included. We’re all people who wish to express ourselves and that shines through our words. Have you ever noticed that you use a limited set of words in your life. This even if you might have mastered your copy of Barron’s to flog the US consulate later. You think he’s all fascinated about the IIT/IIM atmosphere? Welcome to the world of Indian Chick-lit. India is one crazy nation churning out engineers mindlessly. Parents throw their kids into IIT/PMPD coaching centres in 7th grade. Why, it starts with Abacus classes in 1st grade these days. So why not? We’re talking of a sizeable target audience here. And besides, if we could lap up Miss.Kaavya Vishwanath’s stolen tale simply because A.She’s an ABCD and B.She’s from Harvard, I don’t see a reason not to love Chetan Bhagat. My personal favorite. I adore his female lead characters. They’re not silly nitwits (there are other women to make up for it) but are bold, career driven and they know exactly what they want out of life. Which, is the reality today.

" Holiday Sneer 

It's always funny to me when people wish me a merry Christmas. I mean, I can understand the whole holiday spirit and cheer and whatever, but the whole thing means nil to me. However, I did watch so many hours on the Discovery Channel about the life of Jesus, Mary, and everything else surrounding the New Testament that the Disocovery Channel could muster. I watched so many hours, in fact, that I had a dream last night that I was Mary, Noah (of the Arc), and Jesus rolled into one. 

For Xmas eve I went over to my friend Ridge's house in Queens. We watched Peanuts cartoons, Edward Scissorhands, and ate Jumbalya or whatever it's called/spelled. Afterwards I headed back into the city a little earlier than planned and had a quick drink with Marc. I also tried to climb into his suitcase so he could take me to Australia with him for when he goes to interview the Vines. As I was heading back home, my brother Lawrence called me just as I was driving past him on the street in my cab. I jumped out and joined him for a drink at some cheesy club that was hosting a Matzoh Ball. It was so incredibly lame (I yelled out ""Sausage Fest!"" as i walked in and got shot with dirty looks all around) that we left after 20 minutes. He headed off to the new Crobar and I went home. Apparently the Lubuvatch Organization were in their Mitzvah Mobile outside of Crobar trying to recruit new followers of the ultra-orthodox jewish cult-like group. When I was little my mom used to take me to visit Rabbi Schneerson (sp?) who is the person the Lubuvatch's look up to as a sort of profit. We'd wait in a long line in Brooklyn for hours and hours and walk up to him, hand him a dollar, he'd give us a blessed dollar in return, mumble something or another, and then we'd go off on our way. I was about 8 years old when we did this, so my memory is a bit cloudy... however, I'm sure he brought happiness to a lot of people. I'm just confused by what the Lubuvatch community is trying to do with their Mitzvah Mobiles... i should do some research. 

Speaking of Lawrence, he changed his friendster photo to images from high school. He was so fucking cute and new wave. Look!. 

Yesterday, for Xmas Day, Nate the fabulous Roommate, cooked an amazing meal for his bandmates. It looked amazing... I couldn't eat it cause it wasn't kosher, but basically it was chicken rolled with ricotta and feta cheese, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Nate cooks! He's like the best boy in the whole world. He also got a Christmas tree for the apartment which he decorated with white lights and blue balls (to pay respect to Hannukah), and we made an angle for the top using an image of Thom Yorke i found in Blender magazine. 

After dinner I went to the movies with Karen and Jordan to see ""Big Fish"" (I was crying like a pms-ing girl who has just watched a Sally Struthers ""kids in africa need your money"" commercial at the end... not to mention squealing everytime Ewan came on screen). We all noticed Drew and Fab in line for popcorn behind us and so this prompted Jordan to ask quite loudly while we were sitting down ""I THOUGHT DREW AND FAB WERE OVER?"" not noticing them sitting two rows directly in front of us. God Bless Jordan for delivering the quote of the night. So Drew and Fab are back on! 

 
When I got home, after going to Lit, I watched the World Idol competition that i had taped while at the movies. I'm totally in love with Kurt from Norway's performance. He was so utterly amazing. He sounded a lot like the singer of Kent. I think i'm gonna buy his album. 

 
Free Jack White items are for sale just in time for belated holiday gifts. Incase anyone is interested, i'm a women's medium. Thanks to Rachel for that link. 

Finally -- I'm DJing at Don Hills on New Years Eve. The party is apparently gonna be really great, so if anyone reading this needs something to do that night, you should go. Come and say hi to me if you do! I will probably be very drunk and possibly try to make out with you and then you'll also discover my inability to remember anything and total need to document everything with my digital camera as a result. I promise to also play ""Ice Ice Baby."""

It has become a common sight to see children as young as 5 years old in the spotlight singing and dancing to the latest film songs, dolled up in fancy clothes and layers of makeup, trying to behave very much like adults- tinsel town adults at that. While the tremendous talent demonstrated by most children is truly amazing and applaudable, it is debatable whether it is ethical of us to push children into a commercial world of make believe, where their talents are being harnessed into making money. Also on the downside, the children are being subjected to stress beyond their years and maturity levels and also, in some cases, to abuse. It comes down to us to sort through the goods and evils of reality shows and come up with some very necessary decisions – should reality shows for children be encouraged or banned? Should we come up with stricter measures to ensure the well being of the child participants?

There is a general belief that religion and spirituality are outside the scope of examination using scientific methods. I beg to disagree. Science comprises observation, theory and verification. All human experience is based on observation. In ordinary life, the result of observations, over a long period of time, is called experience. However science requires the observations to be objective, systematic, accurate making conscious effort to reduce errors by repeating the experiments and having it reviewed by peers. Similarly the difference scientific theory and others is that it constructs a theoretical model based on logic and mathematics. This model has to be consistent with the observed facts. The last stage is verification during which a prediction is made and a new experiment is done to verify whether this is correct. For instance theory of relativity predicted that light rays would bend when they pass very near the Sun. This was verified and found to be correct.

"OM Shanti Shanti Shanti   You must have gone through some unpleasant, uncomfortable moments in life when you are not FEELING GOOD about things, about situation or about people. Whether its just about salt in food or somebody around you whom you don't want in the moment or you stuck in thick traffic or somebody behaving in a way which is disturbing you or sometime for no reason we don't feel good. The most often what we do we blame others and complain about things or people about the way we feel. And this happen to most of us and most of time without being even aware about it. So what is the way out?   Here is what you can observe. Whenever you are going through some unpleasant feeling. Just give a pause to yourself and obsever what is happening inside? How is the state of your mind? Is it cluttered, agitated, heated up or heavy. In principle this is what is reflecting out (if you not ready to accept this truth say it most of the time ). So when you become aware of this disturbed state mind, just remind your mind to be peaceful and calm right now. If its too difficult give a bigger pause and just tell yourself that you are commited to inner peace, you are peace :) and first become peaceful inside. You will see immediately things will be more clearer.

This I observe after reading Guruji's one knowledge sheet where He says, ""Forget about knowledge, God, service any good thing in life, first comes the PEACE. If there is no peace nothing can happen."" And to my experience this is so true and striking peace at first place make a tremendous difference. Its so amazing.

So next time you feel any unpleasant moods or moments: give yourself a pause and remind yourself about inner peace and chant inside Om Shanti Shanti Shanti! (Om Peace Peace Peace)

And Share your experiences.
All Glory to Gurudev"

"the place is Residency...that is where this picture is shot. in 1857, when India fought against the British, the Indian Army attacked the Residency in Lucknow, where the British forces luxuriously resided. this particular grave is of a man called M. V. Nazareth who died on 5th August,1890 and was one of the defenders of residency during the seige of 1857.he was 75 years 8 months and 26 days, when he died...he was survived by his daughter who mourned him deeply. He lost his wife, Eliza Carina in the seige of 1857, who was 36 years 2 months and 8 days when she died.  Moving on to read the epitaph of Late Mr. M. V. Nazareth...
""ONE JUST SHALL REJOICE IN THE LORD, AND SHALL HOPE IN HIM,
AND ALL THE UPRIGHT IN THE HEART SHALL BE PRAISED.""

Now reading the epitaph of Mrs. Eliza Carina...
""THOU HAST PROTECTED ME FROM THE ASSEMBLY OF THE MALIGNANT,
FROM THE MULTITUDE OF WORKERS OF INEQUITY.""

Now at this point we need to clarify the fact that three bowls containing the porridge were all made of difference materials, each with different thermal properties. This explains why when tasting Daddy bear's big bowl ofporridge discovered it was much too hot; mummy bear's medium sized bowl was freezing cold, and baby bear's small bowl was at an acceptable temperature. One can only assume that mummy bear's taste in cold porridge is not completely bonkers. Anyway, chavpig that she was, goldilocks ate up all of baby bear's porridge. This is described as a somewhat gluttenous act, even though we are initially told that baby bear's bowl is incredibly small. He's probably still being weaned off salmon. Like any good greedyguts, Goldilocks decided that she might as well sit down, and spotting the bear's three chairs decided to try them one by one. Now, Goldilocks is obviously a right fussy bitch, and daddy bear's chair was considered to be too hard, and mummy bear's chair was too soft and lumpy, like a bean bag or something. Can you imagine taking her to DFS for a new three piece suite? She'd be a bloody nightmare.

But these are not very comprehensive and have to be supplemented by rules each society consider necessary. These are the rules of morality and rules of law. Whereas the internal rules need no implementing agency, the external ones need agency to implement them. Early on the group leader was the authority for this purpose. During the course of time the village elders, village panchayts, the chieftain of a county, the king, the Emperor and the Government became the implementing authorities. Any one familiar with law enforcement will know that 99% of people have to be obedient to law under internal compulsion not under external threat of detection and punishment. This is usually achieved by indoctrination from childhood onwards during the course of education or otherwise. Here comes the role of religion. Every religion is a moral code. Observance of the moral code is essential for the faithful to attain whatever may be their spiritual objective. The very high percentage of faithful among humans is, I think, based on an internal programme built into our genes. No religion will stand the test of rationality. One needs a very high ability to suspend disbelief to be faithful. My theory there is an inbuilt gene, which ensures this for the majority of people. There are many other essential roles that religion plays. It relieves our fear of death and life after death, it gives hope for the hopeless, it makes it possible for one feel bliss due to religious fervor which like other human moods (happiness, sorrow, grief, pain, anger hatred, etc.) needs an outlet. It satisfies the need for performing rituals, which seem to have a psychological impact on humans. I am not aware of any society, which does not resort to rituals.

I am sure a lot of people attending training would have posted about the nature of training, some maybe even about training especially at Haldia. The very reason I started to blog from our training premises is because I wanted to get over my frustration. So I’ll stick to the positives. Food, Learning and Entertainment is definitely not going to be a part of it. Sorry guys, the less said the better. Being at Haldia,I’ve learnt to manage things myself,manage finances et all.But, I would have done that anywhere.Whats specially positive about Haldia ? Right,It is a village, but its not all that pollution-free or clean-green.Thanks to the industries.They spew fire 24×7 and contribute to more holes in the already hollow ozonosphere.Nothing positive yet ? Wait for it! The people are the asset of this village (teenage guys excluded).Innocence personified.Their life is simple and they have no reason to complain.Born and brought up in a city for 22 years, our life looks so complicated when compared to theirs.

" Will it be used for digital video content, ie, TV ? Why would we want it to be used for TV ?

The internet has the opportunity to continue to be transformative. There are applications out there that can change the quality of our lives.  Im not talking about the ability to update your facebook, or check out what where everyone is at on 4Square and twitpic what is happening to your friends and followers. Social Media is one more amazing communication platform that is impacting our lives. But its not tranformative.

There will be transformative applications that need all the bandwidth they can get. Medical, Transportation, Defense, Gaming, Simulations and who knows what. As computers become more powerful, we need to be able to send more data to the cloud where they can crunch data and return it to us.

That is the value of an open internet. The things we cant imagine today. The applications that are just dreams because  they dont have enough horsepower and bandwidth to work today. I want the internet to be a platform for amazing. Not Gilligan’s Island reruns.

I recognize that with openness comes the risk of the least common denominator dominating.  Porn has just as much right to dominate the net as any other app. But should it ?

Yes it should. The lesson of TV over the internet vs TV over digital cable or satellite isnt about openness. Its about the value of Application Specific Networks. DIgital CAble is an application specific network. Its only job is to serve up content and it works very well.

The FCC needs to recognize this and start working with internet broadband providers to define tunnels,  Private Virtual Networks  or just plain reserved bandwidth that are saved for future applications. When a transformative application presents itself, there should be an opportunity to define the network to optimize that application."

"Forgiven not Forgotten 1
The meeting of the Indian Council of Textile Owners had just dispersed. The lounge of the hotel ‘Grandeur’ was filled with rich businessmen, old and young alike; the young entrepreneurs were being introduced to the elder members by the Chairman, Mr. Ashok Sahai.
At the centre of the lounge stood Mr.Ryan, Ryan Jindal, surrounded by a group, consisting of the richest members of the council. He needed no introduction. The Jindal Textile Corporation had been the most powerful and successful industry in India for the past 15 years and had only doubled in its value ever since Mr.Ryan inherited it after his father five years back. Ryan had been an MBA fresher when he took up the responsibility; everybody knew there was something else in the man that made him what he was- the king of the Jindal empire. He had the strong and slender build of an athlete and was dressed in a black suit tailored to perfection. His body looked chiselled, with not a single vestigial muscle. His face was angular with a sharp, pointed nose.he had black curls that fell over his broad forehead. And his eyes… people who conversed with him rarely looked at his eyes, they made one uncomfortable. They played a huge contrast to the sophistication and aristocracy his clothes displayed. On the surface, they were insolent and impersonal, but anyone with a little more insight could see that they were only a screen to something more savage and terrifying, like the fores of nature bottled up in human form. 
At present, he was completely bored of the flattery he was being entitled to by a group of businessmen around him. They were saying something about him being the responsible son and the future badshah of the textile world. He smiled and nodded appropriately to all the comments, but his eyes were shifting, scrutinising the groups of people around the room. Suddenly they fixed onto someone, someone standing with Mr. Ashok, being introduced to some others. His eyes never lost sight of her for a moment. He stared at her as she stood there- tall, slender- a picture of elegance. Her face wore a smile- a smile that reflected beauty and self- confidence, but more than everything, they deepened her eyes and the colour on her cheeks. A simple sari of blue silk adorned her, but she looked like she would hardly have looked less elegant in a pair of jeans or trousers.
For a few moments, Ryan looked at her and then turned back to the conversation immediately around.
After a quarter of an hour, he heard Mr.Ashok’s voice, “Mr.Ryan, may I introduce to you Miss.Tamanna, and Ms...”. “Mr.Ryan, Ryan Jindal, I know him quite well, Mr.Ashok.” “That’s my pleasure, Ms.Tamanna.” Ryan stretched out his hand, his eyes looking straight at her as if he were challenging her. She met his eyes with defiance and took his hands coolly. Even as their fingers touched, his palm enclosed hers. The warmth from him seemed to spread all through her. Her eyes wavered just an instant and she was the first one to withdraw her hands. 
For a moment there was troubled silence, and then Tamanna composed herself and managed a weak smile, “Nice to meet you Mr.Ryan”.
“Of course, Ms.Tamanna, looking forward to see more of you.”
In sometime, Ryan took leave. He never stayed back for the Council dinners. As he walked back towards his car, he thought of her again. There was something about her, in her poise, but she had wavered from that at his touch. The thought made him happy, though no girl had ever resisted his touch. But he knew this had been different. She had been genuinely surprised, perhaps troubled, at her own response. He would find out more soon.
Thinking so, he directed his remote at his car. Something was wrong, it refused to open. He pressed again, no response. “Is anything the matter, Mr.Ryan? That’s my car.” Tamanna stood loking at him, hands folded, a smug smile on her face. Now it was his turn to be genuinely surprised. “This is your car?” He had every reason to be surprised. The car was the first of its kind in India and he had been the first Indian to get it. He loved cars, especially, huge, black ones. He would never have imagined anyone elseat the Council to have ever owned one like that. She broke into his reverie, “If you’ll please excuse me,” and she pressed the button on her remote. The car dutifully opened its door for the rightful owner. As she walked past him to get into the car, he involuntarily shifted aside, and saw his car parked some 100m away. “Good night, Mr. Ryan”, she said and just sped off.
For one moment he stood dumbfound and then a smile crossed his lips, a cold, cruel smile. He had discovered what was different about her. After a long time, he had been challenged. He felt a gush of adrenaline. She was an independent will, a tigress. He would possess her, he decided, “Very soon…”, were the only words that came out of his mouth."

The convention overall went really well. Every year it just seems to get bigger. I've been to a lot of gaming conventions in the Houston area and Owlcon remains the one to go to. A lot of those conventions come and go, but Owlcon has always remained rock steady. I can't wait until next year. This year was a bit special to top it off. Since I won the logo contest, I got to see my design on hundreds of gamers!! I can't really say I was wild about the purple but hey, it was my design on hundreds of gamers!! It was a very cool feeling. To make it all the more better, GURPS game I ran went really well and I even got to catch up with an old Army buddy I used to work and game with. Back when I still wore Army greens to work instead of pajamas, Matt and I used to hobble along company PT runs together at Fort Campbell. We went to AIT together and somehow managed to get the same duty station together for our first (and last) assignment. Both of us not being strong runners on our PT tests, we ended up doing mandatory PT.

Music - The fact that we have something called music to appreciate is utterly amazing…I consider it one of the ingenious things we discovered(mind you..not invented).The right music just lightens up your day! It still amazes me as to how we react emotionally to different frequency of sounds…how do we do that ? hmmm..I am no scientist so won’t delve any deeper :)  I know that the genre of music is a touchy subject for some…for example: i am not a fan (at all) of heavy metal…I detest it..but doesn’t mean i wont allow anyone else to decide for themselves.  Personally i have no particular genre to call ‘my kind of music’,it all depends on my mood…when i am up for it..I enjoy mostly romantic and soulful music..but i also enjoy R&B,Bollywood and Pop a lot too..Of late..soft rock and punk rock have caught my eye(Green day :) )  Anyway that’s a lot about me…just one question…how many of you out there listen to a particular song a million times till you are fed up? (that is my exact story..yeah i am quite boring! :p)  Coming to favorites I have way too many…so many that they can’t even be called favorites anymore.. :) Music can REALLY heal..it’s just a matter of listening to the right songs  so go pick up your i-pod,phone,laptop(or any other instrument that plays music) and get happy!

" Calling all Moms
I know it's been awhile since I've blogged. Things have been a little crazy lately. More on that later.

Now, I have two questions for all you moms out there. Eli is turning 1 next month (how did that happen?!?) and so I need to start looking for a new car seat for him. I don't know much about the next size. I've heard things about 3-in-1 and booster-convertible or whatever, but I really know nothing. So, rather than researching like I should, I thought I would just ask:

1) What kind of a carseat do you recommend for a 1+ year-old?

I don't really want to spend a fortune, but at the same time, I know it will get used through the years, so I don't mind investing in something that will last.

Next, I need ideas on food. I seem to be a little stumped on what to feed Eli lately. I know there are probably lots of things I'm not thinking of. He LOVES to feed himself and is not so keen on the purees anymore (mostly because I have to feed him), but he only has 4 teeth, and he's not a year old yet, so there are things he can't eat yet, so I need ideas. His favorite things lately (finger foods) are avocados, bananas, crackers, cheerios, and peas. I'm still breastfeeding, so he gets a lot of his nutrition from me, but we are nearing the weaning phase, so I need to find more balanced things to give him. So, the next question:

2) What foods (finger foods mostly) do you recommend for a 10+ month-old?

Okay, I'm ready for the suggestions now. :) I've seen other people do things like this on their blog, and I'm always amazed at the awesome responses, so I'm counting on you! Any and all comments are welcome (even if you don't have children). Thank you! :)"

"Notes from Mussoorie - Day 1  -   It's a clear night full of stars in Mussoorie. The chilly breeze makes me shiver under my spine and somehow i am enjoying it till the core.

Looking down is Dehra valley lit up like a golden jewel. What an amazing tapestry! Amazing view captured by my retina.

The room that i have taken is a reminder of ancient British Era. It's a heritage hotel and well kept one. During morning the Sun wakes you up as you open the window.

Balbir Singh, my room attendent reminds me of British officers who had a personal attendant saying ""Haaji Sir"" on every possible statement of mine.

I am enjoying my stay! Thank you Mussoorie for being so kind.   After initial hiccups i reached Mussoorie today Morning, with completely no idea what is in store for me. This is the least planned trip for me.

It was 11 by the time i reached and then after getting refreshed i opt for some walking aroound the Mall Road just to get the feeling in.

I came back after an hour with the notebook and started to settle. Since there was no planned activity i was enjoying my state of doing nothing.

After finishing late lunch generally i got the feeling as to how would it be if at all i would be able to meet Mr. Ruskin Bond, after all he lives here only! What if i could just sneak into his home and have a small conversation! Embroiled in these thoughts only i ventured to move out in search for the book shop.

It took me only 15 mins to reach and i bought two books, ""The room on the roof, Vagrants in the Valley"", his very first book and ""Notes from a small room"", his latest. I asked casually whether he visit here sometime and much to my surprize the owner said that he will be coming here anytime soon!!! This was least expected.

Though i had updated my status in FB ""Meeting with Mr. Bond"", but i had never even imagined it would come true. There were very few people and all were waiting for him. After sometime he came in his chauffer driven car.

There was no Tamasha, no security guards, no protocols. He was walking and talking like any of us do. Such is his simplicity. I was completely taken aback. He signed on both of the books and i chatted for a while, shared a joke and more sitting just next to him!!!

I came back to my hotel room. After sometime i realised that one of my wish has just been fullfilled. It's been so kind of him to take his time out. I wish i could meet more people like him.

Mussoorie has really been kind to me. Thank you Mussoorie.

Written on 13th Feb just before finishing the wonderful day."

" The Kitchen Cure
A couple of years ago, my husband and I received a trip to a spa as an anniversary gift. This is not the kind of place where you lie a reclining chair and get a gentle massage, a pedicure and a facial. We arrived at this place at 7 o'clock in the morning and became inmates. They locked up our things. We each talked to a medical doctor. After we received a personalized schedule of treatments, we were nudged into the labyrinth. The inmates, stripped of our belongings, were shuffling around in matching slippers and white bathrobes. No one spoke. It was Fellini-esque. The experience was jarring and liberating at the same time, since we were subjected to being pummeled with streaming jets of water at fire-hose velocity, dipped in vats of bubbling clay, massaged with compounds, stretched with weird machines, closed up in rooms of various degrees of heat and coldness, scraped, kneaded, and otherwise indelicately handled. Loic and I were separated at arrival and raised our eyebrows at each other in passing down the halls throughout the day. We were then left to silently bake together in a cloistered courtyard, exhausted, draped over reclining chairs overlooking the Mediterranean sea, drinking cups of healing water that were refilled by nurses. It was all we could do to make our hands touch each other across the great divide between our wooden recliners while we watched the sun set. We left that place completely drained of all energy but in the weeks to come, wow! The difference was amazing.

Fast forward to today. Since we bought the country place a bit over a year ago, our apartment in Lyon has entered a sort of Feng Shui limbo. Especially the kitchen. We didn't put much thought into how to establish the new kitchen in the mountains, nor did we give furnishing it a line in the household budget. Instead, we shuffled and shuttled things from one place to another in boxes and bags for awhile, then hit the brocantes and doubled certain small things like corkscrews, knife sharpeners and silverware. But since this wasn't thought out or planned in any way, things settled the way they fell. Add to that the arrival of our son, Ian, last spring, adding baby accoutrements and products that never found their places and a vast cut in spare time even to consider the issue, and we've got ourselves a nice big mess. I've been trailing along behind in the wake of all of this. I haven't had the courage to even address the general dysfunction, I just feel more and more like I need a helping hand. This was why, when I came across the 2010 Kitchen Cure at Apartment Therapy, I took the plunge.


They told me I had to dispose of my lovely olives.

Our kitchen is extremely small, and I like it that way. For years, it was a very efficient one. But now it feels like an abandoned rats nest, for all the things I've stolen from it to nourish the kitchen in the mountains. All the bits and scraps of useless junk that remain tucked into every corner have lost their meaning. In addition to problems with clogged energy, I really am going to have to replenish the spirit of my kitchen. I want it to be a place that nourishes my creativity again.

The first assignment at the Kitchen Cure is to tackle the refrigerator and the pantry, removing everything that's expired, inedible, or no longer useful. One shelf at a time, we purge things that no longer belong there, and brush the dust off of that which we will keep. We have a week to do this. This is a task that just takes time. In my house, the kitchen and pantry have begun to spill out into our living space. This first step will make space and find places for the many things that seem to never have had a place to begin with. It will give me a chance also to replenish the essentials."

" As a former schoolteacher, I know just how broken education is and how far away it is from hitting the mark of supporting the development and exploring personal potential for young people. One thing you can do for the next generation of young people is share what you know on the internet. If you lay down the breadcrumbs as you live and you share what you know, it will live on and help others stand on your shoulders and build past what you have done. There are lots of benefits to going to school, but it doesn't have a monopoly on knowledge or hold the only keys to a great job.

I see sharing as the future of business too. By sharing our designs with the MakeBot community, we've found a fantastic community of passionate people who are willing to tell us what we're doing right and support us in figuring out how to improve. The examples go on and on.

What are you sharing? What frontiers do you see for sharing. Are there things that you're not sharing that you could?"

"Haappie haapie new year - ;) well u kno there is an old sayin "" Whatever u begin on the new year flourishes"" ;) in t same hope, well i m blogging today in the hope that i ll blog regularly ;P yu c i m very buzzzy ma....don get much of tym! :P lols

Neways,I wanted to write on a long promised post, The child in u....Well, i m still nt findin t ryt mood for it....for wen i write it i want it t be in my flow, n its a post tat i hold v close to my heart, that i cant write it without the ryt mood....

So i m gonna skip tat post for nw n write about sumthin tat everyone needs in their lyf..Hope...Well, i guess i m pretty obsessed with the law of attraction, that it is featurin in every other post! :) 

Lets dig a bit deeper on this old sayin, y ppl insist v start on new yr, new beginnin et al...well hidden beneath all this is a basic and primal instinct...Hope,Enthusiasm and Agape...ny1 who ve read paulo cohelo will kno all about agape...well agape is an extended form of enthusiasm, a feeling of joy hope and belief......Lemme quote a truth that is true in all cases..Faith is the burning force behind everything...Anyone, ryt frum agnostics to atheists to deep believers one thing is common..Faith..Faith needn be on lord..For us weak beings, who cant focus on a singlke point, we need an idol, a place of worship, a point to focus on called god..A superior power who we need to c n feel..

In my opinion atheists and agnostics are more deep believers, for they can focus without seeing and feeling..They trust..in themselves and keep pushin themselves..They are more stronger mentally..Denyin the existence of god doesn mean He doesn exist...He is there..In faith..The belief..

Explorin more on faith, havent v heard stories of healing and belief, of extrordinary circumstances, jus based on belief?? Kamalahasan, who s well known t be an atheist, is he nt successful!!? he is...cos he has faith in himself and his profession...Where faith is, there is excellence..

One may wonder y i m goin on n on about faith n belief..For on this nw yr,all i wanna share with u is that wonderful feeling called belief...faith...Jus believe in whatever u want...Close ur eyes, visualize and feel it..never give up and never lose hope...Be happy for all u have and believe u ll get whatevr u want..this is nt philosophy...it is t underlyin truth behind all relegions..Jus believe, take lyf in its stride and trust...Enjoy every moment..This is not jus for t new yr...U follo this everyday will be a new yr to u... 

Stay Young @ heart for that is t most important thing in lyf!! Havve fun.. A happy happy new year to all :)

I spent a bad night. A night in pain due to spasms that kept hurting my spine and back the entire night. After trying out various different positions to ease the discomfort and failing, I sat up and screamed ’shut up’. And having done that, resumed my attempt at slumber. I had the soundest sleep for the following two hours before the alarm went off to wake me for the morning gym routine. This is unusual. Not the screaming, the alarm waking me up. Normally my apprehension of whether it shall work keeps me half awake till the designated hour. But it did not last night, or well, really, this morning. I sailed into the gymnasium with forced enthusiasm and despite the few odd muscle catches that occurred, by the end of my two hours there was a definite sense of improved condition. The bounce came back, the heat of the morning sun on the lawn was welcomed and the entire day has been spent in spasmless wonder !! I wore a new dress.

" Sorry, Charlie

Until recently, it was assumed that Charlie Crist, Florida's gay Governor, would take an easy walk from Florida to the US Senate in next November's election. Until Charlie's support started to crumble around him, that is.

A Rasmussen poll from last week shows that Crist's primary opponent, Mark Rubio, brought the race to a dead heat: 43% to 43%. In an effort to court the conservative wing of the Florida GOP, Rubio is running hard to the right. A hard right wing Senate candidate would be a much harder sell to the people of Florida than a popular Governor who enjoys an approval rating of 68% of Democrats!

As if that is not enough, Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart (pictured), brothers who serve in Congress, have withdrawn their endorsement of Charlie and Rubio continues to press hard. Florida's GOP is conservative and Charlie pitted against Rubio could mean that the Governor could lose his primary election and be out of a job at the end of next year. Crist had to make a choice between running for Governor or US Senator. Perhaps it he picked the wrong one.

In the report, Lincoln Diaz-Balart explained that Crist had 'left us [the two brothers] no alternative and he knows why.'

Do tell Lincoln, do tell.

Huck goes pro-gay

Well, he's supporting a gay guy for public office. Of course, a few weeks after a guy you paroled slays four cops you'll do anything to change the narrative about yourself.

Andre Bauer gets Huckabee's backing:
Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer is being backed by former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee in the GOP race for governor.

Huckabee, who served as governor of Arkansas before finishing second in S.C. Republican presidential primary in 2008, endorsed Bauer in a fundraising letter for the lieutenant governor and Huck-PAC, Huckabee's political action committee.

'Andre Bauer is a champion we can believe in,' Huckabee wrote. 'He has fought for the people of South Carolina since the day he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1996. As Lt. Governor, he has ruled against every single proposed tax increase, saving the people of South Carolina $2 billion.'"""

However, there was something highly unfortunate about these missions: they were waaay before my time! I wasn't around to see it! I did get to see the launch of something equally interesting though: the New Horizons probe. This wonderful probe launched on January 19th, 2006. I watched the live feed from NASA's website (after watching the failed launch on the 11th). It's main mission is to study the outer solar system and Pluto, but New Horizons will give us more pictures of Jupiter and the Jovian moons than Pluto. By pictures, I mean the works- not just that puny band of the spectrum which we call "visible light"- particle readings, radio waves, light, orbital charts of the moons, you name it. New Horizons will then go on to study Pluto and its moon, Charon. Pluto, which recently got demoted (arguably a wise move) from planet status. After this, New Horizons will go on to study the Kuiper belt, a large belt of asteroids and "plutoids", or near-Pluto size objects. It will leave the solar system in 2029 (estimated). However, perhaps fittingly, New Horizons will never catch up to the Voyager probes.

New Beginnings

My contract says I start on July 1st...but today, I found the familiar dance beginning. Checking with this person, that person, writing notes here, there....wondering...what implications for doing this, that... Back in the swing of things. But in a new place.
My new position. Hmmmm.....due to start in a couple days, but already, this whole thing has started. ""What time will you be in?"" my secretary to-be-asks. ""Uh, I'll see you tomorrow....9 a.m."" I say. And I mean it. Work is waiting.

I met the person who held my new post today. He had served for 17 years...the equivalent of a high school junior's lifetime...so hard to believe. I knew how I had felt, leaving Greenville after one year; Central Montcalm after 5....so how could I really know his story? Leaving after all those years. It had to be hard. He said he has plans to do ""other things"", yet, I know it had to about kill him. To leave things in my hands. And now, all the things he worked so hard for...will they continue, or not? 

I appreciate all he did for me. He went beyond really, what he needed to do. I don't take all that lightly. He seemed non-affected, but he had to feel a little void. And I can't blame him."

"Relations - There are two types of relations. One is Blood made relation, and another is Time made relation.
Blood made relations are like father, mother, sister, brother, cousin, grand parents and all(family members). This type of relation is constant one(no change in love, love forever), you love your father means, you love him from the day you were born till the day of your separation(death).
Time made relation are those which are dependent on time, like friendship. As time pass by, the relations becomes stronger or weaker, according to the separation (distance between the two friends ). But there are some relations which grow stronger, even if the distance between the two is high.
So it is necessary for the relation, whose strength(love for the person) goes on increasing regardless of the separation, just to end increasing the strength. One wants to shift that relation in constant one, to the loved one, blood made relation, letting the person to become a part of your family. So the question is, why to choose only husband and wife, why can't it be brother and sister or brother in law and sister in law. Don't you love your sister, don't you want to see her happy. Love is all about to wish to see the person you love, happy.
And the answer is, strength of that relation(love for the person) is so much increased that you don't just want to see her happy, you'll do anything to see her happy, you want to be with her always. And among the given relations, in family only husband and wife stays with each other.
As, this kind of relation was time made relation, I don't believe in love at first sight. [:D]
Well now a days, we should think for brother-brother relations also :P"

Bradford's in Ghana

Well, we sent off our first missionary. Bradford left Thursday for Ghana.

It's very exciting. All missions are wonderful. The service you give, the growth you make, the testimonies grown, the life changes made, the truths learned and the covenants accepted. He will have challenges but we expect it to be a wonderful time for him.

I made a new blog for his mission. missionarychambers.blogspot.com I just put his addresses up there. I was having trouble up loading photos so that will have to wait until another day.

Primary Temple Trip
Our Primary had a great temple activity in September. It is the 10th anniversary of the Columbus Ohio Temple.

Here's the whole crowd, the Powell Ward Primary. Ellery and the other 11 year old boys were at a campout. Too bad They missed it this was a very special.

Patrick loves the temple. He was very excited to go and learn about the temple.


Here's my handsome Owen. He was so reverent.


We toured around the temple and learned new things on each side of the temple. We enjoyed the gardens and heard the former Temple President and his wife speak too.

"Let's Talk About Food And Health
David Jesse's recent article at annarbor.com about a Mitchell Elementary School program to provide weekend ""food backpacks,"" made me think it is time to say something more about food, and health. 
Different schools and school districts have different feelings about how much they should help provide a safety net for students. Some schools have stepped up to the plate--for instance, Bryant/Pattengill in Ann Arbor runs a clothes closet, and the Ypsilanti Public Schools run one for the whole district. Other schools have been reluctant to jump into providing services, because the need is so great, and they don't want to be seen as a giant social service agency.

On the other hand--kids who are hungry, cold, or sick don't do very well in school. I think that those schools that try to support students' other needs are doing the right things. But remember, knowledge is power, and a lot of people who are eligible for programs don't know they are eligible. So here are a few resources. Please share them!

1. Free and Reduced Price Lunch Program (which includes breakfast): you can register for this at any time during the school year. If, for instance, you had work at the beginning of the year and wouldn't qualify, you might find that you qualify now. Ask for an application at the front office of the school your child attends. Some schools use this as a way to identify kids who qualify for other benefits/scholarships. (I've written about school lunch here.)

2. The Food Stamp application is now online. This is new, and it is great news. Spread the word. A lot of people are surprised to find out that they qualify. If you want an estimate as to whether your family will qualify, here is the link to a food stamp calculator. And here is the link to the application. 

3. Similarly, you can now enroll your kids in the MIChild/Healthy Kids program with an online application. (Women 19-44 can be enrolled in the Plan First family planning program through the same application.)

4. The Regional Alliance for Healthy Schools has clinics in several local schools, including schools in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Willow Run. Check them out here.

5. Pregnant women and kids up to age 5 can be served by WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)--and that can help stretch the overall food budget. WIC also has some satellite clinics, which is helpful for people living on the edges of the county."

“Rich and creamy New York-style cheesecake swirled with pureed fresh strawberries and a hint of lime juice, all nestled in a buttery graham crust” beamed the lunch special menu. S was wowed. Well who wouldn’t be, look at the picture! She changed her order from bread and Earl Grey tea  to just the dessert. The waitress gave an understanding nod, openly feeling sorry for S’ state, the lonely vegetarian with meager choices and magnanimously approved S’ desperate attempt to fill her grumbling stomach with something. The cake looked big and S considered that she might be overestimating her appetite. “Big deal! It’s a piece of cake , how filling can it be?”  she thought, brushing such preposterous thoughts away. The waitress  brought the cheesecake ceremoniously and with a wink and a patronizing pat, left it on the table and busied herself with the arduous task  of filling the giant glasses with sparkling water and a slice of lemon.  The ambrosial aroma of freshly pulverized luscious strawberries blending with the citric tanginess and the curdled creaminess of the cold cheese tingled S’ nostrils and her pleasantly awoken taste buds without fail began their task of salivating. She took in the deliciously beautiful pink, white and brown on the swanky porcelain plate for a minute. Choosing the spoon was a feat of unimaginable controversies. All the high-society spoons made her uncomfortable for they resembled normal spoons in their design and dimensions save one or two tweaks in the whole shape of the spoon; and it looked more like the spoons were mutilated in an uncanny manner rather than made chic to reflect the sophistication of the place. Sighing , she picked the one that seemed closest to the fork family and dug right in.  In her first mouthful, she couldn’t help let out a low moan. It was THAT good. The strawberries were so fresh that it appeared like they were picked right then from the invisible fields behind the “Only Authorized Personnel” door and the corporate glass and plastics. The cheese was so creamy that she had to wonder what good deeds she had done over her different lifetimes and merits she had earned from the guy above that such a palatable pleasure was bestowed upon her. The cheese was so rich that she had to wonder what good deeds she had done over different lifetimes and merits she had earned from the guy above that such a palatable pleasure was bestowed upon her. The crust was light as air and the mocking hint of lemon danced lightly between spoonfuls. Her tongue had seen paradise.  The cake actually slipped from her mouth to the foodpipe, it was that flawlessly smooth. For the next few minutes, nothing in the physical world was actually perceivable except the wonderous dessert. Then suddenly her taste buds grumbled. They were saturated with the sweetness, they complained. Come on, S pushed. But she knew she was wearing herself out, she was exhausted from the creaminess of the cheese. Every mouthful introduced a fresh blast of the thin crust and the rich creamy cheese that felt like a blow and knocked her out. She tried everything , drinking sips of ice cold water, making conversation with the people sitting around her, interspersed with a million tongue clicks to free it of the sultry sweetness and the heavy aftertaste. It was impossible. All right, she decided. It’s you against me. The cake smiled back peacefully. She took a deep breath in and downed 3 spoonfuls blindly. Then drank water at once. Whew! She opened her eyes to see that the cake was hardly half done. Oh no! Her colleagues had started their main course already, after soup and starters. And she was still stuck with this royal cake which she had received even before the others’  starters had arrived. It was then when her stomach grunted. “I’m full! Stop stuffing me”, it instructed. She knew she had to ,but she couldn’t stop.  She had to finish what she had started. ” I cannot be defeated by a cake, and a cheesy one at it.” she declared. But she revamped her strategy and decided to tackle it one spoonful at a time, chanting ‘I can do this’ every time. The cake smiled back ruefully. After an hour, she looked proudly at the pink -white-brown crumbs sticking on the plate. And even though her motor skills were temporarily incapacitated and she couln’t move, she had finished the Colossal Strawberry Daiquiri Cheesecake for good. “Big deal! It’s a piece of cake , how filling can it be?” She shook her head and took out her red wallet.

Last week, the same 7-8 of us who used to meet daily in shcool days, had to send a thread consisting of 300 mails just to decide when and where we all shall meet together, after a gap of aroud about 4 months. This week, my friend and colleague Rajeswari spent endless hours communicating and organising over two days, just to decide where, when and HOW she and 4 of her friends(Sathya, Swetha, Priya and Swathi, who used to meet daily in college and even in weekends), can meet this weekend. See the HOW, that is a new clause added, first it was anytime anywehere, then it was anywhere but in a particular time coz someone has n’t returned from college and so on, then it was at a particular time, at a particular place coz people come from far away on a weekend, so they dont have enough time to come to all the friends place etc. Now it is how! ya How! everyone is available, but all are busy, “how can we meet? hey I have work, next week our project release, I have a client call next week, so i ll be home at only 9:00 pm and i have work on Sunday too”, so more often , people silently come home, sleep for a day , take rest and go back.

" All in all, the impression I got was of an incredible wealth of software, written and maintained by dedicated volunteers all over the scientific community.

During the Q&A session, we touched upon the usual topics, like Python 3 transition, the GIL (there was considerable interest in Antoine Pitrou's newgil work, which unfortunately I could not summarize adequately because I haven't studied it enough yet), Unladen Swallow, and the situation with distutils, setuptools and the future 'distribute' package (for which I unfortunately had to defer to the distutil-sig).

The folks maintaining NumPy have thought about Python 3 a lot, but haven't started planning the work. Like many other projects faced with the Python 3 porting task, they don't have enough people who actually know the code base well enough do embark upon such a project. They do have a plan for arriving at PEP 3118 compliance within the next 6 months.

Since NumPy is at the root of the dependency graph for much of the software packages presented here, getting NumPy ported to Python 3 is pretty important. We briefly discussed a possible way to obtain NumPy support for Python 3 sooner and with less effort: a smaller ""core"" of NumPy could be ported first, which would give the NumPy maintainers a manageable task, combined with the goal of selecting a smaller ""core"" which would give them the opportunity for a clean-up at the same time. (I presume this would mostly be a selection of subpackage to be ported, not an API-by-API cleanup of APIs; the latter would be a bad thing to do simultaneous with a big port.)"

"golden era What life had got for me was the greatest tension wen i finished my high school. Engineering was for sure but which college was like picking one chocolate out of a 100. I was always in the lost world as to where to go,and who will accept me..hmmmpf finally i'm here in this place which i have hated at times but the place i said hi to real life... The first day of college was a real confusion to me.It was a whole new place with total strangers.But it didn't take time to get to know people. The first day I talked to 2 girls in my class and it was very strange how we became very close in a very short period of time. i was the naughtiest of the 3 and yet both of them were caught always. everybody thought i was the very silent and quiet type..lol...all the teachers thought we were naughtier than the boys(they were actually the silent type though.)
Was ragged by seniors,time passed. it was time we had to split to different departments. we had a farewell in the class. We had fun everybody had to do a task. All of them made me do aerobics in class(was quite embarrassing to do it in front of the whole class). Then we entered the second year. life became busy and we saw less of each other. I met new people.it was quite tuff to cope up with new syllabus new teachers, totally new people but as we got to know each other it was fun. exams, symposiums,friends...i really donno if time flew or i lost track of it.. Now i am in the final year and i really miss college and hostel when i go home. i always wait to come back. i find it really strange how these people totally unknown to me became a very special part of my life. All these days were fun filled totally. Who will know what sorrows are when u have friends like mine.
It is very hard for to believe that there are only six months for the golden moments. no more last benches, no more bunking classes, no more canteen, no more teasing,no more birthday treats,no more commenting on teachers. Just can't explain how much fun all this was. amidst all these there were petty fights, after which we kept our egos at bay and hugged each other and cried. all of us had a shoulder and ear to lend for each other always. Hey guys who have influenced my life so much this is for you.... Thanx for being with me in sun and storm... every little thing you do means a lot to me. And yes i will miss all of you and all of this when i am graduated. tears fill my eyes when i even think of the day.There is so much u have taught me.

dedicated to all my frens:
preethi , abirami & anusha - the people who taught me to stay cool. life is short enjoy life to the max.
sharmila,subashree, viji,krithika,Ramya,Aarathi -people who taught me that life was practical.
Sundari and Surya-two people who make my day by fytng wid me. jus cant stay widout fytng wid them silly fights though..
deepika,sirisha,pooja,geethanjali-people who taught me to take life as it comes.
ravi-the person who never lets me down,always keeps me cheerful.
and there are other people who have influenced me. they are too many to pen.
hey guys the amount of encouragement and support you have given me is what makes me feel the way i am today. Its you people along with my family who have stood by me as a strong support during my hard times... Thanx once again and love you all."

"Change!!!
Its been almost five months since i graduated and started work and here i am now, at a standstill...Life seems to be in a pause phase at the moment. 
Its strange how you change from a teenager to a grown up in such a short period of time, all cos of a simple fact that now i am on my own..lol..sounds strange doesnt it...It was much clear back then as to what, where, how etc,...but now life seems slower than it ever was. 

Theres this strong urge in me to be someone, to do something and show the world but then again, the fear and the insecurity within makes me feel even more vulnerable and weak. 

Sometimes i find myself over excited and filled with positive energy and optimism and other times i am like, comparing myself to the better ones and saying wow, am i even getting there...i guess the more i compare, the more i pull myself down, well thats when i am jealous..but otherwise it kinda motivates me to do even better.
Sometimes i feel great about myself but many a times, especially when i am with others, i find myself comparing myself with them for every little things...i guess its gotta do with the insecurities that has build up within me over a period of time..may be the past..lol...Anyways i gotta work on it...after all, its the change within that can change the exterior circumstances isn't it...Anyways as for now, i have to do my laundry and i hate it..

Meanwhile you take care and happy surfing!!!!"

" Artificial Flight and Other Myths (a reasoned examination of A.F. by top birds)

Artificial Flight and Other Myths
a reasoned examination of A.F. by top birds
Over the past sixty years, our most impressive developments have undoubtedly been within the industry of automation, and many of our fellow birds believe the next inevitable step will involve significant advancements in the field of Artificial Flight.  While residing currently in the realm of science fiction, true powered, artificial flying mechanisms may be a reality within fifty years.  Or so the futurists would have us believe.  Despite the current media buzz surrounding the prospect of A.F., a critical examination of even the most basic facts can dismiss the notion of true artificial flight as not much more than fantasy.

We can start with a loose definition of flight.  While no two bird scientists or philosophers can agree on the specifics, there is still a common, intuitive understanding of what true flight is: powered, feathered locomotion through the air through the use of flapping wings.  While other flight-like phenomena exist in nature (via bats and insects), no bird with even a reasonable education would consider these creatures true fliers, as they lack one or more key elements.  And, while some birds are unfortunately born handicapped (penguins, ostriches, etc.), they still possess the (albeit undeveloped) gene for flight, and it is indeed flight that defines the modern bird.

This is flight in the natural world, the product of millions of years of evolution, and not a phenomenon easily replicated.  Current A.F. is limited to unpowered gliding; a technical marvel, but nowhere near the sophistication of a bird.  Gliding simplifies our lives, and no bird (including myself) would discourage advancing this field, but it is a far cry from synthesizing the millions of cells within the wing alone to achieve Strong A.F. Strong A.F., as it is defined by researchers, is any artificial flier that is capable of passing the Tern Test (developed by A.F. pioneer Alan Tern), which involves convincing an average bird that the artificial flier is in fact a flying bird.

Now we know the goal, but what about the technical hurdles?  Our visions of the bird wing are becoming more accurate, it’s true, and soon we may have a full model of every muscle, bone and sinew, but even this is merely information.  There’s never been a realistic timetable of how long it would take to replicate even a portion of the wing, whether through biology, engineering or otherwise.  And even the most optimistic birds have yet to explain how we plan to accurately rebuild the delicate array of feathers that are essential to flight.  Do not misinterpret this pessimism as cynicism, mind you, as I do believe these studies are worthwhile, as we will learn more about ourselves and what it means to be a bird.  Replicating birddom, though, is almost definitely out of our reach.

Even if we were capable of completely achieving the above, how would we ever know if it was a true bird?  Where does flight really reside?  We may build a functioning, flapping wing, but what if the essence of flight is deeper, hidden within the cells or elsewhere?  We would only succeed in making a hollow doll that only gives the appearance of flight. If this is the end result, is it a worthwhile investment of our time and resources?

There are religious birds who believe God made Bird in His own image, and while I do not share in most of these beliefs, I do think there’s something to be said about the motivation behind creating Strong A.F.  Perhaps, as we are the only creatures on Earth capable of flight, we want to push forward past our current capabilities, perhaps even augmenting our own flying capacities if independent A.F. is an impossibility.  This could be interpreted as noble, but I would argue that there’s very little utility in replicating what nature has essentially perfected.  Why spend millions on an artificial flier when there are so many birds out of work?  Many weaker fliers have already lost their jobs to gliders; is it wise to rush to make ourselves obsolete?  A.F. research may unlock some hidden mystery about ourselves, and it may make the lives of some more comfortable, but at best, true Strong A.F. is a pipe dream and at worst a challenge to what it means to be a bird."

" Playing with Xcode and AppleScript

In case you noticed a post about PDFopener and were curious, I've been playing with Xcode, the Mac OS X development environment. And AppleScript. I guess either could be useful if I ever build a robot with a Mac brain. I wonder how hard it would be to use Xcode to develop for ATmega MCUs. At any rate, the reason for the PDFopener project was that I got sick of problems downloading USPS shipping labels so I dove in and fixed it.


set text item delimiters to "".LabelGenerationServlet""
set stripOther to first text item of fileName
if stripOther is not equal to fileName then

AppleScript is somewhat bizarre to me, an outgrowth of HyperCard's HyperTalk language (anyone remember that?), sort of a pseudo-English programming language. It's a bit mind-boggling for a dude used to C and Perl. I didn't spend any time really learning the language fundamentals but was able to slog my way to making a functional program, chipping away at it little by little with a lot of searching on macscripter.net. Trying to do too much at once and it would all fall apart. Like building a house of cards. That's not unlike my robotic coding experiences thus far, actually.

Unicorn-1 Arm

Time to arm the robots! No, not for world takeover. I'm talking about robotic arms. Digging through the stack of old robot stuff I ran across a photocopy of this ancient, August, 1980 series from Radio-Electronics.

The first article offers a neat, simple design for a robotic arm that seems relatively easy to build with some basic tools and careful techniques. Interesting excerpts are reproduced here for educational purposes.
The elbow-forearm actuator is comprised of a large motor and threaded rod that pulls a on the midpoint of the forearm. The shoulder is actuated, I think, from a motor within the robot. Details on the design, dimensions, etc, are given below.
To save weight, I suppose one could change the design to use aluminum tube instead of steel rod for the side rods. They're available from home improvement stores, hardware stores, and online shops.

Some parts (right) need to be machined, unless one comes up with a simpler way to fabricate them. If so, I think all that's really needed is a drill press, a way to ensure drilling a hole through the center of a rod, a cutoff saw, some hand tools, and a tap or two.

An electronics article from the 80's would be good for a chuckle. But since motor and mechanical technology haven't changed all that much, I submit that these 30 year old plans are still relevant for the modern robot builder."

" Umami Nation: Kombu Dashi Smackdown
January 19th, 2010 · Uncategorized

posted by Dave Arnold

Kombu, a variety of giant kelp (seaweed), is a cornerstone of Japanese cooking. Kombu is particularly high in free glutamic acid—the umami maker—but its flavor is otherwise rather delicate, so it is an excellent source of MSG.  By the way, glutamic acid + sodium = MSG. (You’ll get much more on MSG and umami in our upcoming post: Umami Nation: MSG the Superspice—the Headache is in Your Head.)  This post is about kombu broth.

Several types of Kombu are used in Japanese cooking.  For a discussion of kombu, I refer you to this website or this book.  We used ma kombu which was harvested—as many good things are—in the cold waters off Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island. Yuji Haraguchi of True World Foods, a premier supplier of fish and Japanese products (we buy our fish for ike-jime from them), brought us the kombu.


Ma kombu. High quality stuff from Hokkaido. Brought to us by True World Foods.
Most traditional books will instruct you to place a piece of kombu in cold water and then heat that water until it just begins to bubble, upon which you immediately remove the kombu. But recent work in Japan has shown that optimal glutamate extraction is actually obtained by steeping kombu in 65° C water for about an hour. Several years ago, when we first heard about temperature regulating kombu stocks, we told a group of Kaseiki chefs that they might want to use an immersion circulator. They looked at us like we had three heads (in fact we had only two). Undaunted, we vowed to thoroughly test kombu stocks in the circulator. Two and a half years later, we finally got around to it.


Setting up the tasting.
Setting Up the Test
The tests: we would make one broth traditionally, and one like the Kaiseki do—by attempting to regulate water temperature to 65° C on a typical stove.  After carefully reading the dashi sections of some our favorite books, we settled on 10 grams of kombu per liter of liquid—though intuitively this seemed low to us. For a third test we would circulate the kombu in water at 65° C.

We could think of two possible reasons the circulated broth wouldn’t be as good (or better) than other techniques: 1) if the air churned in by circulation had a negative effect, or 2) if the crappy heat control of the stovetop was actually a benefit; i.e., if temperature fluctuation somehow made the stock better. To control for the air problem we added a test of some kombu circulated in a vacuum bag. It didn’t take long for Nils and I to realize the bag was probably a good idea anyway, because we would get some vacuum-infusion benefits.

Yuji from True World also suggested we try some cold infusion, so we added a 10 gram/liter overnight infusion to our test, a 10 gram/liter overnight vacuum infusion, and a 20 gram/liter overnight vacuum infusion. We never heated these infusions with the kombu in them. As a final test, Yuji suggested we heat the regular overnight infusion in the traditional way (until bubbles start to form), with the kombu in it. We ended up with 8 different kombu broths, and we tasted them blind.

What We Didn’t Test

We didn’t test a temperature range. We didn’t do 60° versus 65° versus 70° C. Next test.
We didn’t test the level of free glutamate in the broth. Most literature will tell you this number is important. But we can’t measure free glutamate here, and we thought it much more important to judge the broths on taste alone.
We didn’t test the interaction of the kombu broths with other umami-producing ingredients like bonito flakes (katsuobushi) or shitake mushrooms. Bonito flakes have inosinic acid, and shitakes have guanylate, both of which act synergistically with the glutamic acid in kombu to create a lot more umami than kombu alone.
Often a kombu is re-used to make a secondary dashi after the primary broth is made. Some of the extraction methods we used rendered the leftover kombu virtually tasteless, which would make a secondary dashi impossible.  So we didn’t test secondary dashis.
The Results


Kombu Tasting Results. We tested three different groups (red, blue, and green), and then pitted the winners of each group against each other to figure out which kombu dashi reigned supreme. The red block tested methods of making kombu dashi at 65° C: directly in a circulator, in a vacuum bag in a circulator, and by trying to maintain 65° C on a stovetop. The blue block tested cold infusion techniques: in a vacuum bag at 20 grams kombu per liter, in a vacuum bag at 10 grams kombu per liter (traditional amount), and 10 grams of kombu in a liter of water without a bag. The green group pitted traditional kombu dashi--10 grams per liter started cold and just brought to the bubble and strained, versus cold infused then heated dashi also at 10g/liter without a vacuum bag.
Vacuum bagged 65° C circulated kombu stock reigned supreme!

The verdict was decisive. Unanimous and unequivocal.

In the future, we will test vacuum bagged 65° C kombu at 15 g/liter and at 20 g/liter, because 20g/liter won the cold infusion category.  We should also try cold-vacuum-infused-then-heated broth.  We think it would win."

" In the event some form of ubiquitous entertainment comes first ,  takes over the net and saturates it, how is the FCC going to solve the bandwidth traffic jam ? They wont ever be able to put the bandwidth genie back in the bottle. Screaming at broadband providers to spend the money wont work any better than screaming to expand highways helps to alleviate rush hour traffic

The FCC wants Internet 2 at universities to flourish and develop new things. But where are they going to roll them out to if all of our bandwidth to the home is being used for some new form of 3D virtual fantasy sports?

I just dont think these things will just manage to take care of themselves.  The reality is that when we run into future internet application roadblocks our politicians will jump in the mix and attempt to “solve” the problems. You know where that will get us.

We need to start the process now of putting some bandwidth to the home away for a rainy day. Not only do we need to preserve bandwidth in the last mile, but the FCC also needs to  figure out a way to create a transparent market or exchange that allows competing applications a means of knowing how and when they will have access to bandwidth when, not if,  it becomes constrained.

And if you really want to make things interesting, the company that is doing the most work on realtime markets and competing for resources that i know of ? ….. Google.

Deal with it today or struggle with it in the future."

"Power of Sattva...Unleashed in Mumbai   23 to 26 Dec 2009 witnessed 490 people experiencing the Part 2 course in the famous Yogi Sabhagraha Swaminarayan Hall in Dadar. Sattva personified Rishi Vidhyadharji mesmerised all of us with his Satsang Aerobics Yoga at midnight (6 am for me is midnight...he he), his brilliant Sadhana sequence and his Q&A sessions in the satsangs early morning (if you have slept from 4 to 6 pm then 8 pm feels like early morning).

Rishiji would conduct the course from 6 am to 9.30 pm. Inspite of such a busy schedule he offered 2 hour knowledge sessions on 2 days from 6 to 8 pm to YES!+ volunteers.

Some snippets: (NOT verbatim...just jotting the essence from what I remember)

This should be your goal: Becoming 'MUKT' (free) from the 5 deepest, strongest and oldest impressions: Food, Sleep, Sex, Fear and Laziness. He added that once you have become free from these impressions then you will know what your real purpose in life is. The humour and liveliness with which he explained this was exemplary.


Q: How to avoid being conscious when amongst people?
A: Rather than bothering about looking good, focus on feeling good. In looking good you lose your naturalness and peace. When you feel good then you will NOT become a football of others opinions and will be more effective.


Q: Should we be perfectionists?
A: Rather than looking for perfection, be with that which is perfect


Q: How to handle competition as it involves comparison with others?
A: Competition is sugar coated greed and jealousy. A person who is caught in competition is a victim of greed and jealousy. He tries to do several things 100% and gets stressed. Its important to BE (not necessarily DO) 100% in whatever you do.


Q: I am confused about marriage. How to decide whether to marry or not?
If one or more of the following five are of concern (needs) for a girl, then she should marry: Security, Companionship, Sex, Progeny and learning surrender
If one or more of the following four are of concern (needs) for a boy, then he should marry: Companionship, Sex, Progeny and learning surrender

Q: While on my way to meet Guruji, the excitement I feel, is it feverishness or longing?
A: While on your way if you are relaxed then its longing, else its feverishness. And on meeting him, if Guruji doesn't look at you and you don't mind it as you are happy that YOU saw HIM, then it was longing and if you feel upset or disappointed that HE didn't look at YOU, then it was feverishness.

" Is Yemen A Safe Place To Visit-- Or Live?


The drive from Sanga in Mali's Dogan country to Timbuktu is not for the faint of heart-- and not even possible without a solid 4 wheel drive, off road vehicle. When we did it a couple years ago, we got lost in trackless wastes-- with an experienced guide-- and broke down several times. But half way between driving over boulders in Dogan and the rutted track through the Sahara there's a stretch of paved road around a town called Douentza. There's not much to the town at all, but there's a roadside cafe where truckers and travelers can stop for a plate of slop and a cold drink and a chance to stretch and possibly realign one's spine. Ahhh... good old Douentza. I decided to fast but Roland had some kind of spaghetti lunch that took an hour or so to prepare. While waiting we met a Spanish architect, his wife and two daughters going in the other direction. We swapped road tips. And, as travelers do, we also swapped travel stories. They'd been traveling the world's forgotten places as long as I had. I told them about Afghanistan and Ceylon. They told us about Ethiopia and Yemen.

Yemen, in fact, was their greatest adventure. It was before the daughters had been born and the two Spanish students had been kidnapped by Yemenite bandits. It was strictly a business affair, no brutality or violence or anything like that. They were treated as guests and a month or so after being detained the ransom was paid and they were released... with the story of a lifetime. 

Saturday night, for no particular reason, I tweeted a NY Times story by Robert Worth on how the Yemeni addiction to qat (khat)-- a very thirsty plant that is mildly narcotic-- is making the barely habitable country completely uninhabitable due to the depletion of the aquifers. It's a story of desolation and ruin... and danger. It still isn't a safe place for tourists to visit. On the other hand, it isn't a safe place for anyone, including the Yemenis.

The first time I ever really thought much about Yemenis was when I was general manager of Sire Records. Legendary music man, Seymour Stein, had signed an Israeli-Yemenite single, Ofra Haza (one of her songs is below) and told me how big she was in Europe, how much he loved her and hated her manager and asked me to try to break her in the U.S. We put out several albums and singles by Ofra and she had some success but, while she may have been ""the Madonna for the Middle East,"" her music was more popular in gay dance clubs than on Top 40 radio. I always thought it odd, though, that when I visited Arab countries-- especially Morocco and Egypt-- people were wildly enthusiastic about her. No one minded that she was Israeli, let alone Jewish.

With album titles like Yemenite Songs, Yemenite Love, and Desert Love and with songs ""Im Nin' Alu,"" ""Galbi"", and ""Daw Da Hiya"" it would be hard for all but the most casual of listeners to not wonder about the relationship between Israel, Jews and Yemen, an ostensibly hostile, backward, fundamentalist Arab country-- the place, in fact, Osama bin-Laden's family moved to Saudi Arabia from. Saturday's Wall Street Journal fills in some gaps about Yemen and Jews with a fascinating story, Secret Mission Rescues Yemen's Jews by Miriam Jordan. She confirms the country's backwardness and hostility and goes into the ongoing operation of how the Obama Administration is rescuing the few remaining Yemenite Jews and settling them suburban Rockland County, New York in the hamlet of Monsey. (Monsey has around 15,000 people, 112 synagogues and 45 yeshivas and less than half the people there speak English at home.)"

"Stuck in Legal Marketing Limbo? Here are Answers.
Imagine the scene … members of the law firm’s Executive Committee sitting around a conference table, unable to reach agreement on which legal marketing programs to implement. There are so many choices now, from Google AdWords to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other forms of social media. 

Legal marketing used to be simple. The Yellow Pages served as a leading advertising channel for personal injury attorneys, while a basic website and nice brochure met the marketing needs of most plaintiff or defense law firms. Add in a strong referral network, and the average law firm of 20 years ago was able to keep the phones ringing without too much work. 

How times have changed! Effective legal marketing now involves many specialists, from search engine optimizers to video technicians and website analytics experts. Of course, you still need copywriters, graphic designers, and event coordinators. 

Today’s competitive marketplace frequently delivers business to the law firms that can master marketing, rather than the best law firms. Does all this sound familiar? 

Avoid Inaction in the Face of Uncertainty

Confusion is a common response I see among lawyers struggling to select the best marketing approach. A natural tendency under these circumstances is for the law firm to either do nothing, or to continue with the same tired marketing techniques that deliver unsatisfactory results. 

Marketing your law firm is a critical issue, and the economic downturn has left many firms scrambling to fill their pipeline. There is no time to wait. The good news is that there is a silver lining in the rapid changes of technology and promotional techniques. 

Let the Market Guide your Promotional Campaigns

Rather than fighting with your law partners over who has the best marketing ideas, turn to the marketplace for answers. Marketing is both art and science, where only actual response rates can truly determine the best promotional campaigns for your law firm. 

Develop a plan to systematically test new or modified marketing strategies, keeping those that work and discarding the rest. Internet marketing offers an unprecedented ability to monitor campaign performance on an almost real-time basis, so you will be able to compare response rates and client acquisition costs across multiple promotions. 

Smart Choices in Budget Allocations

Your marketing budget should be spread across an integrated set of marketing channels (i.e., Internet, sponsorships, events, and advertising) and scheduled against a written timeline with specific goals. Remember that current clients are your best source of new revenue, so be sure to earmark funds for client retention. Take advantage also of the many free or low cost legal directories offered by firms like Avvo, Justia and HG.org to easily increase your online visibility.

Jeeves wouldnt eat on time. He wont play with me. He spent all his time with that big black dog. Things were working out well for both of them until Jeeves's girl started seeing someone else . A big light brown handsome dog. Jeeves was furious and ended up fighting with that dog all the time. It took sometime for Jeeves to get over the pain of losing his love. ( Seriously LOL.. How much drama involved in a dog's life! ) Anyways he is happy with his new girl now :) With the passage of time i observed too many changes in Jeeves' behaviour . He grew from a mature , poised dog into a naughty and playful dog. ( How cool is that!) He plays like a kid. Drags doormats , hides under the bed , chases cats around (that is so like a dog) and so on . He used to be this BIG foodie who lived for eating and all of sudden he became damn stubborn and choosy. He acquired a habit of running away from food and i had to follow him all the way to make him eat. Whew! that was a quite a chase!!

" I was eventually directed to the Paediatric unit, and took the long walk with a sense of dread and trepidation. Most parents would feel this way on that walk, but normally because they were worried about whatever accident had befallen their child. I knew Mate was fine, they just had to un-Humpty Dumpty him, maybe that's why the paranoia was so bad. Maybe if I was doing the parent panic foxtrot, pacing up and down waiting to find out what was wrong with him, I wouldn't have even noticed it?

We sat down with the Triage Nurse and I answered another series of questions as she examined his head. They were a little more probing this time, dwelling more on previous visits, particularly the bruising episode. Mate had been 6 months old when I brought him in with some unexplained bruises on his arm. He hadn't fallen or anything, it just didn't make sense. That was the start of 48 hours of testing, monitoring and questioning. The Ward Sister could barely hide her contempt for me and what she thought I had done. That was until the second day, when she herself left him bruised after a straight forward blood test. Whilst she never actually apologised for her suspicions, she did offer me a cup of tea for the first time. They never did find the reason he was bruising so easily, but it stopped after a few days and never repeated itself, touch wood. "

""Would you be free this weekend?"", Rihaan asked Suhani rather casually. She replied, ""yes"". This was the green signal that Rihaan was waiting for quite sometime.

Rihaan and Suhani met in office for the first time and there was something that clicked between them. They became close to each other in due course of time.

They started spending time with each other on weekends, since during weekdays it wasn't possible owing to strict professional conditions.   Day 2
Ravi and his Manager Karthik went into a meeting room. Ravi was told to move to Japan as an onshore coordinator for six months duration in the guise of learning opportunity.    Day 3
Mohan had a tough time convincing why he cannot relocate from Bangalore. Bimal, his Project Manager, was self proclaimed ruthless bastard.

He sarcastically made derogatory statements about Mohan and even stated in one of the Team meetings that ""People should be flexible if they have to grow"". But the most ugly statement which made everyone unhappy was ""When one is asked for onsite assignments people jump on to it it's only when asked to relocate within India is when Father's have Heart Attack and Mothers have serious injuries!"".

Everyone in the room cursed Bimal.    Day 4
The drama started with Bears & Sterns going bankrupt. No sooner most of the US financial companies started to believe that they will be hit and that too severely. Retrenchment plans were made in hurry and Pink slips started to arrive in hefty numbers.

Indian operations which were not on the radar for most of the time suddenly came into existence. One morning Lehman Brothers went Bankrupt! Sudheer, who was employed in the IT operations of LB at Mumbai, was shattered.

He went to office early that day.The day was Sept. 16, 2008    Day 5
Wasim gave his homely pleasures and moved to Bangalore in search of better professional life. Apart from cultural shock he was amazed at the lack of Infrastructure in the so called IT city of India. 

After spending a full fortnight he wasn't sure of the apartment which he wanted to live in. He wasn't accustomed to the whooping 10 months advance as a security theory! Moreover he didn't had that much of sum.

Not many people outside Karnataka knows that to take a rental accommodation in Bangalore the tenant has to pay a full 10 months advance as a security and the rent is high by any standards perhaps second higher after Mumbai."

It is as if they are showing you the way.”  Don’s on to something there… because Bill’s obvious love for the Bible ignited a curiosity within me.  Bill has a doctorate degree.  In addition to being a Pastor, he’s a Professor at the local University.  Early in our friendship, when the aforementioned conversation took place, I needed to know why this intelligent man said such things about the Bible.  I needed to know why I could look him in the eye and tell he wasn’t just spewing out Christianese when he claimed to love it.

In Bill’s sermons, he takes us to the time and place being discussed.  We who listen to him speak hear context.  We learn about the culture of the people.  We are given an insight as to what the text meant to them… how they understood it.  I wanted to know how Bill knew these things, so I asked (that desire for knowledge is actually what led me to the place where I told Craig Gross from XXXChurch that I wanted to enroll in Seminary – which Craig responded to by telling me X3’s Esther Fund would pay for it).  I’ve been learning how to study the Bible, and I have to tell you… I get so much more out of it when digging into context and culture than by just reading the words.   I’ve read through the New Testament four times so far and I get something new out of it each time."

TATA sends me an email telling me about this wonderful broadband connection that has 'not much hidden charges'!!..its written right across the middle..Should I just laugh, or sympathise?

"Kuruksastra..... few debates and a walk out Kuruksastra is over. I can proudly say that this time i saw it. For last three years its something i only heard from other people, even though i attended its previous versions but its not more than an hour if you sum up the time.
All in all it was good to see whole college in such a pace with everyone satisfying their intellectual hunger through drama, debate, dance and many many other things. It creates those rare moments when the year recognition is lost and all comes on same floor to compete something which almost impossible to judge. It was Shankar Mahadevan who eclipsed everything in the last evening. The impeccable voice, the aura and the charm which gripped the whole college for about 2 hours and i could still feel his grip on this college by seeing status messages on gtalk, orkut and facebook. I choose sitting in Ctv rather going in and dancing and i really enjoyed, one can imagine the atmosphere in stands.. As far as i can see it was simply Awesome!!!!
The thing i felt is he did not sung those for which he is recognized and admired. To make the mood instead of singing ""jhoom barabar"" he must have sung ""Koi kahe"" from DCH. No song from Lakshya and no from his album ""Nine"", atleast he should have sing ""Noor E Khuda"". I felt satisfied twice, one at ""Maa"" and other at ""Breathless""... Overall its quiet a time and the feeling of real Shankar Mahadevan standing in front and singing is good, atleast for someone like me who never saw any showbiz personality ever... else than myself :)

Maximum time of these 3 days are passed in NMV auditorium watching Hindi Lits.. Pride of this college.. They win everywhere... If somewhere they did not won means they did not took part, its as simple as that...
The confidence in organizing committee was something, i m sure, every participant was scared of. Vishnupal led the team like Eric Cantona would have led the Manchester United years ago, attitude of the best player+captain could be seen in the confidence of each and every team mate...
If football commentrator Andy Gray would have been there... He must have said.... Take a Bow son !!!! Take a Bow !!!!!
The hard work of organizers was visible in the quizzes they prepared. Especially Antakshari, i think it was solely made by Amitabh and it was Something....
I was wondering how confident participants were and virtually giving lessons to someone like me who never ever even dared to climb up to that stage.
Boys and girls from all the years and from many colleges...

Apart from all this few things which took my attention...
First is the debate.. The confidence of participants was extremely good, i wonder how no one fainted or even a single one wavering. But.... there was a certain lack of preparation, i bet there was... Everyone was talking about something they guess should be rather than some solid points...
There was a certain lack of reasoning and every one was busy showing there ability of argument, useless argument..
Like in finals, topic was about Reality shows.. Many came and blabbered lines of Dinkar and Nirala... ""Jo bhara nahi hai bhaawon se......"" and all those stuff which has nothing to do with Reality shows. Leave alone reality show, i dont think Nirala or Bachchan ever said anything even on Show business. Instead you should have prepared why are reality shows so hit and why or why not they are affecting society as whole. Anyhow if you want to quote someone, tell us what Stephen Spielberg or Coppola or Prahlad Kakkar said on effect of stars on us.. Quote something relevant rather shouting bullshit....
I dont know exactly what India lost in creation of Pakistan but i can tell what India gained and thats the endless number of debates.. Its Pakistan everywhere, even the partition of states is somewhere related to Pakistan.... One was saying if we want to fight Naxalites we must take guns from all the policemen and send them barehanded... Upon asking to elaborate this he himself do not know what to say. One took partition of State as his topic and end up speaking for 5 minutes on corruption, no relevance at all. If some one someday show the videotape to that guy i dont know will he speak again in his life ???
At last i came to conclusion that there must be Pakistan's hand in my bad performance in class, because its the root cause of each and every problem in India..."

" And luckily I did not use plurals to describe them both. Or I would have died from an alcohol overdose. HAHAHAHA - okay, not funny actually. Ahem.

Yesterday, 5th of March, 2 days post-birthday: Colleagues JA, Ivn, Rchd, LJS and CK conspired to intoxicate me to the extent I start dancing on poles. KR was designated 'drive P-chan home once she is drunk'.

BUT ahaha. I did not dance on poles. In fact, I am frickin' good at drinking. I WAS drunk, yes, make no mistake. And I did puke, yes, make no mistake.

BUT I WAS IN CONTROL. Muahahahaha.

So now I sit before my laptop, feeling kinda heady and giddy and sleepy. As I sms-ed my colleague, I am no worse for wear - the hangover is not so much a hangover as it is a kind of loopy feeling. Which is kind of unpleasant but not unbearable.

BUT by God's good name. NEVER AGAIN. I solemnly vow to not touch beer for AT LEAST A MONTH. Serious. I've had enough alcohol to last me for at least ten years.

So here is what happened. (Pictures are terrible, but it was very dark.)"

"THE REVENG OF THE 'GEEK'!! -  Well ,I am supposed to be Preparing my Market Research questionairre right now... but as my mind is ... it keeps me away from anything important i try to do and brings me back to things like blogging n chatting!!

So , While I was preparing the survey questions ... I realized that all that is happening in this world right now is marketing and business. Companies today rely more on the marketing and advertising than on the quality on their products. They hire the best MBA people in the hope that they can lure more customers into buying their products. And this is the reason more and more people today see more oppertunity in MBA. Even in an Engineering course , companies see the communication skill and marketing appeal of the candidate more than his technical capabilities. That is , if you do not have good communication skills , you cannot expect to get placed in a company even if you have great tecchnical skills.

Even during our UFMR( User Friendly Market Research) class ... all we learn is how to fool people into buying a particulatar product. And questionnaires and surveys are some amazzing analyzing tools which ask people ' HOW THEY CAN BE FOOLED INTO BUYING A PRODUCT ??'
A great example for this is DOVE SOAP , which , on the pretext of reducing the contact area of water and soap so as to reduce wastage of soap due to melting , gave a curved shape to its soap , reducing the overall volume of the soap in the process.And it ws portrayed as a pathbreaking idea while all the company did was to reduce the volume and increase the price.

The best example for this, though, would be POLO - The Mint With A Hole. Even the tagline shouts at peoples faces that it is again reducing its volume by cutting a hole in the tablet. But by the sheer power of marketing , the company was not only able to turn it into a grand success but it made the line - 'A MINT WITH A HOLE' a USP for the product. And to add cherry on top , they released the cut holes as another product too!!

So , no offence to marketing people , but i believe that marketing is just an art of fooling people and Market Research is the art of asking the people how best to fool them!!( No offence to my UFMR sir too...)

That is why , I believe that in today the world needs more and more geeks, who can develop the products he way they were supposed to be and sell them on the basis of their quality, not on the basis of driving the consumer's mind. And when the time comes when 'the world is run by geeks' , it surely will be a better place to live in ."

If you have one of these A-Frame studio easels you are also probably familiar with the tendency for the easel tray/support to wobble when you are painting. For years I tried all kinds of fixes, putting in way too much thought and creativity into something that continued to frustrate me. And then came an idea so easy a caveman could have thought of it: I used wood shims. Now it's easy to adjust my height and get a stable work support each time. Duh... For years I had been working on a 12 x 16 glass palette. It fit nicely in my work area and I had an old cookie sheet that I inverted over the wet paint to retard drying. Then I discovered a large piece of glass packed in with some old sketches and decided - why not? It's 18 x 28 (probably came from an old watercolor). I cut a piece of medium gray mat board to size and taped the glass and mat together with painter's tape. I could not believe the difference this made. I was so afraid it was too large and I would hate it - but quite the opposite.

" APPLE’S IPAD: FOR WHAT AUDIENCE? 
After years of speculation, Apple finally released a tablet computer yesterday called the iPad. There was fanfare! There was rejoicing!

There was also much criticism: everything from it doesn’t have a camera or USB port to it doesn’t support Flash or HDMI out to it doesn’t let you multi-task. In 24 hours we have dozens of reasons why the iPad will fail in the marketplace.

But what if the iPad simply isn’t for the people who are critiquing it? What if the experience the Apple designers have in mind isn’t the one the tech writers and bloggers have been dreaming about for a half-decade? What if you, early-adopter geek fanperson, aren’t actually the target audience?

Humans suffer from a subjective viewpoint. We see the universe with us at the center of it. It’s almost impossible to gauge anything outside of our own desires…when we size up a new gadget such as the iPad we consider first and foremost: “What good is it TO ME?”.

User experience designers, however, cannot long suffer this fate. We must design (and hopefully critique other designs) from a more objective viewpoint.

As our initial subjective viewpoint fades, we might consider the iPad anew. Judging from the videos and early reviews, it makes many common activities very easy such as email, watching videos, and sharing photos. So let’s ask: “Who out there, what market, is this attractive to?”

The iPad is attractive to people for whom a laptop is overkill. Many spouses, parents, siblings, and children in our lives do not use computers in the same way we do. They are likely the primary audience for this device…the people who don’t need single pixel precision but can get by on single finger precision. They may use the iPad in the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom, even the bathroom. But they probably won’t use it in the office…

As designers and critics we must get out of our own head. Subjectivity, our inability to see as others do, can be a cruel master."

"Hand Made! -  It's been really very long since i have hand written a letter to anyone! May be the times have changed too fast. Even on festivals we just do away with SMS or a courtesy call. I wonder how Archies business is going on!

Those were the days when Archies Card could come ""in a very special way"", as the punchline goes and makes you happy! Alas, that was taken by e-card and now just email or SMS.

I think we should once again start this tradition of hand written letters or at least Cards, certain emotions are better expressed in original hand writing.

I had few of the greeting card with me which were given to me long time ago on various occasions and whenever i look at them i go back into the memory lane, and believe me it's a wonderful feeling altogether.    Holi - Festivals of colors
Holi is associated mainly with colors, but for me the association is more then that. The festival reminds me of colors, water balloons, gujiya, papdi+achaar, Kanji Vade to name a few.

I remember my childhood time when we use to play Holi with great enthusiasm. Neighbors use to visit us in  groups and pour color on my parents fully knowing that they are already covered with enuf of it. Sometime they use to color my face as well and i use to run away.

What i do not like is the smell of the colors, it has a pungent smell which i somehow don't like. So most of the time i use to wash my face just after the group was gone.There use to be Pooja at home and then Lunch full of calories. I use to love Aloo kachoris at that time. 

It was great fun until sometime later when the whole perspective changed and the fun element went missing and hence i stopped celebrating Holi. Festivities need to be revisited, on a very high priority basis."

A few weeks ago Bonnie, the more exciteable of the two puppies, charged at me in all her enthusiasm and bashed me in the nose. It bloody hurt. Enough that for the past few weeks I have been taking pain killers and nursing a very sore and tender nose. However, me being me, I thought, "it can't possibly be Bonnie's fault" and so I decided I had sinusitis! Stop laughing at the back.  Having never had it before I scoured the Internet for symptoms of which pretty much boiled down to the ones I had. Except today I couldn't stand it any longer and thought it best to see the doctor. So off I trudged, to his little TARDIS in the next village, and let him have a right good look up my hooter. Prodding and pressing, feeling and caressing, asking me about snot and things on my hankie, he confirmed that my sinuses are absolutely fine. "Have you knocked it recently?" he asked. "Oh, well one of my puppies did a bit since," I answered.  Some more feeling took place before he gave his final diagnosis. "You've broken your nose," he said. He explained how the bones and bits inside work and everything started making sense.

" Sleep - I've missed you
The past few weeks have been a little crazy with our little guy. For some reason he all of a sudden decided to loathe going to bed. He used to be so easy to put down. Give him his pacifier - he starts playing with his hair - and zonk. He's out.

Well he started refusing his pacifier, which I at first thought was great because I didn't want him to have it forever anyway. But then a few days later he started with this bed-hating thing and that has been going on for quite some time now. We decided it was time to just let him cry it out. We've never really had to decide whether or not to let him cry it out because nap time and bed time had never been an issue before, but things changed and we knew he needed to learn to go to sleep and stay asleep by himself.

So...long story short, I've heard a LOT of crying in the past couple weeks but we're finally about there. The past 3-4 nights he's gone to bed at night with less than a minute or two of crying and he's stayed asleep until about 5 am, at which point I feed him and he goes back to bed until about 7 - 7:30. I don't think he's quite ready for all night yet, but we are making progress! We're still figuring out nap time, but we seem to be getting back on track there too - much less crying, much more sleeping.

It's just crazy how all of sudden he can change like that. Of course it always happens right as things are going well and stabilizing. I even took him to the doctor last week. We just didn't seem to be making any progress and I wanted to make sure nothing was wrong with him (I would've felt really bad about making him cry it out if he had an ear infection or something). But, nothing was wrong. I think it was just a combination of teething, growing, wanting our constant attention, and going through some new developments - crawling, standing, etc.

So anyway, this week has been much happier. He wakes up happy now and is much happier during the day too. Babies really do need their sleep and they get pretty miserable when the don't get it. (By the way - he hasn't ever had his pacifier again, so I guess that's good. Some days I miss it, especially at nap time, but I'm glad it's gone).

On another note, we've been enjoying some amazing weather! Eli and I have spent a lot of time outside and it has been wonderful. We go on walks, go to the playground nearby and watch the bigger kids play, sit on the lawn, and eat grass and dirt - oh wait, that's just Eli. 

Anyway, he's a cutie. I bought him a new toy last week at Kid to Kid (have you ever been there? It's second hand stuff, but it's in great condition). Most of his toys are hand-me-downs (I think I've only ever bought him one other toy; poor kid) and he was getting pretty sick of them , so we picked up this cool ""new"" toy last week (along with a really cute pair of shoes). He really likes it and it holds his attention for more than 10 seconds. Woohoo!So that's probably why my blogging has suffered a bit lately. We've all been tired and cranky, but we're coming out of the fog now. Hooray! It sure feels good to sleep. It's been a long time since I've slept all night, so even though he's not making it all the way until 7, he's doing a lot better than he was, and I sure feel a difference. So that's what's new!

We have some exciting things coming up. Jeremy's brother is coming in town this weekend and he and his fiancee are coming for dinner on Saturday. Then my mom comes into town on Monday and my sister Amy and her 4 kids come into town on Wednesday! It'll be an adventure! We're excited.

Oh, and Happy St. Patrick's Day (whatever - not a holiday I get excited about) and sorry this is the longest post ever...

Thank you!
Thank you everyone for your comments/suggestions on car seats and food. It was very much appreciated and Eli is enjoying many new foods lately and is eating a TON (growth spurt? yes). We still need to find a car seat (we haven't really gone shopping yet) but I've been looking online at ones you have suggested, so thanks! I plan on blogging more and putting up pictures later today or tomorrow, but for now, that's all! Thanks again."

" When did I eat algae?

I swear to you, about all I have accomplished lately with any regularity is being sick. Straight up, pukey, green, gross, sick to my stomach. I feel like I ate algae - even though I'm not entirely sure it would make me feel this sick to eat algae, It's an educated guess.


I'm supposed to go to Arizona this week for another Midlife Road Trip adventure. Because of this general state of putrid pukiness, I'm starting to be concerned. What if I am inclined to want to puke off the side of the hot air balloon or throw up when I am  rock climbing or shooting a big ass gun in the desert? I don't care how good the editor is, you can't make vomiting look good.

That's why in the 50's Colonel Tom would yell, ""Chew it back, Elvis,"" and then he would.


I found out today I am not flying this trip but instead am driving all the mother trucking way there with two of the Midlife Road Trip crew - JD (Executive Producer~ left) & the one known only in this country as The Dude (camera god ~ right). Why I'm driving and not in an airplane this time is a long story that's not interesting in the least. All you need to know is that it's entirely OK to feel sorry for me.





In fact, I wish you would start right this minute.
I'm an excellent car-tripper. Love it. That's not really the issue. What is getting all up in my business is that me and my algae stomach are going to be trapped on four wheels with two men who will probably spend the whole trip talking about three things that will make me want to spew even more:
Sports (football, baseball, basketball & synchronized pudding wrestling.)
Women (tall ones, short ones, young ones, young ones, young ones, young ones.)
Gross things they have at one time or another thrown up after drinking too much. (Roasted lamb intestines, Doritos they found in their foot locker from college, and for reasons I'm sure I never want to know, an entire package of pink erasers.)
Dammit. I just made myself feel even worse. I think I am about to burp a green bubble. "

"those 25 minutes of my life!  hi all,
This time i am writing my blog after a long time. Its not that i was out of content. Its just that i was little busy in a lot of stuffs. But this time i am out here to tell you a story that every engineering student tells when moving out from college and being a part of corporate world. That is campus placement.
So TCS was the 1st company to visit the campus as usual. I wasn't willing to take chances so sat for the very 1st company. Aptitude test was a cake walk. 80 min 35 questions. That too all logical and quant. :) :) But people scared me so much about upper cut off that i decided to score around 70 percent to be safe from both upper and lower cut off. One could have easily attempted all 35 questions and revised the paper for at least 5 to 10 min if wanted. But there was no upper cut off this time. When results came out all those who did more than 30 questions got through. I did 26. 25 were absolutely correct and 1 was pure fluke without even solving the question.

Next was the interview. The thing for which i was most under prepared i guess. I didn't even know about revenue, goals and other details of tcs. Some people were mugging those also in the morning before going for interview. I preferred not to take any pressure and thought of going rather blank for the interview. You can think of my preparation by the fact that i took printout of my resume 3 times each time after adding or removing something in my technical skills and area of interests. One more big confusion of being overqualified for the job was already out of my mind after aptitude. Many people first advised me not to mention my all 3 projects in resume but i decided to put them on the 1st page itself. Because i was very comfortable with them. So i thought if my technical interview goes on these then i will be very comfortable. Of all the interviews posted on net that i have ever read so far had been perfect may be people write it only when it goes perfect. Even though mine wasn't a perfect one i still took some courage to write it. So now i take you to those 20 to 25 min that i spent inside the interview room and let me know how will u rate it..............
My resume and form was asked and after 3 to 4 min a lady came. She called me in. I went inside the room and closed the door behind me and sat down on chair comfortably.(good start didn't fumble i thought in my mind) and yes i greeted them good morning before sitting. There were 3 people 2 technical guys and one lady (hr) who wasn't attractive but i am used to of it being in an engineering college(There is a proverb ""all good girls go to heaven and bad ones come to my school"")(exceptions may be there though). They asked my name. I told. Then came the first question. Tell me about yourself. I spoke only for 2 minutes. A nice full toss i missed. ( dam me why didn't i speak much. I spoke for 5 to 6 minute when my room mate once asked me same question one day acting as interviewer. )
They tried to ease me by asking how do i feel here. About language problem and food problem they asked. I had to somewhat lie for this question and said people here also speak hindi sometimes( now how many times i have met someone speaking hindi in tamilnadu :)). i like the culture. Food and language are also not a problem. I also added here people are like this that blah blah...... I don't think i ever lied so beautifully ever before. By seeing their faces on this answer i could tell they were not south Indians as they were not overwhelmed. Then he picked my resume and turned to page 2 of it. He asked Why haven't you written Java in your programming skills(i wrote C,C++ and C#.NET). I explained that i know it but i am not very comfortable with it. So he asked 3 to 4 questions from java. Out of them 1 i couldn't answer properly but he was satisfied so moved on to what i had written in my resume. I answered every question very well except one. He asked me what is the difference between c and c++. I don't know what was going wrong with me. Again another full toss and i missed. I told only about how classes work and how structural programming works. Didn't use words like data encapsulation, inheritance etc. Then they came to area of interest in that i had written game design. He asked why have you written this. I explained him that i like computer games a lot and so i thought why not to design one by myself. So i got the chance to explain my project and what was the idea behind it and everything. I told him that i got first prize in Microsoft for this project. They asked a lot of questions on this project. All of them i answered very well.(some of them were very good exaggerated stories). They were impressed. Then he asked me what was the problem i faced in this project. I told them that as it was a strategy game i had to make it very interesting and throw a lot of challenges for players to enjoy it. Again they were impressed by my way of expressing. But one silly question i couldn't answer. My game was on bhopal gas tragedy. So he asked what was the name of the gas released in that tragedy. (f**k..... i was searching this on wikipedia one night before the interview but couldn't see because college wifi was very slow. college wifi sucks i thought.)
They saw other projects and asked some questions on them. I answered very well i believe. Finally they asked what was the thing i learned from these projects. I told them while doing these projects i realized that if we do the analysis and designing part sensibly then we can save a lot of time and work. I explained them how and this one was somewhat right also. ( some times you can speak truth also in interview :P).
So finally my technical interview was over. Now the lady who was observing me from past 15 min spoke for second time. (first she asked in between weather i do these projects by myself or are they part of curriculum. hobby projects of course :)) she asked a lot of questions about me being posted this part or that part of the country. i said i will work anywhere. I thought of saying i can work even outside India but then i thought it would be being over smart. So i kept quite. Then when everything was almost over she asked you are very soft spoken is it because of interview nervousness or you are normally like that. I fell for this one and said I am normally like that. Now she started some chin music and i couldn't have dozed those bouncers as i agreed that i am soft spoken. She said i wouldn't be able to survive in the company and take work out of other people. ( now the only thing i could have done was to hit those bouncers out of the park and that is what i did.) i explained her that how being soft spoken has helped me a lot in my life with some examples. I told her that what all i have done and how i have been part of organizing body of some events and how i have managed to win some prizes on stage performances. They asked some questions on whatever i said. ( i actually made up for that tell me about yourself by telling everything about me in this). She asked me if i faced any problem during organizing these events. I made one nice fake problem and told how i managed to solve it. ( good story in no time i was impressed by myself :P). They were also impressed thinking it to be true one. So they were happy in the end. I too was happy. I boosted every candidate on my way to exit. I never took the smile out of my face during the interview and was at high energy level. :)
So this is how my interview went. After coming out i thought it could have gone much better and i believe it was 60 to 70 percentage of what I should have done. But still if anyone gives his 60 to 70 percentage in an interview it would always be a decent shot.
Next day when after final selection i called home. ( i didn't tell anyone in home before about placement etc until i got placed ;)). Everyone at home was happy for me. My mom asked which one is the next company. I told infosys then my mom said why did you sit for this company then. You should have waited for infosys or waited until someone even better comes. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. :))"

Fed up of apologising for not blogging in a while, so i won't. Apologise. Unless you consider that non-apology as an acknowledgement of the need for an apology, and thus an apology in all but the word. Anyway, where was i? Oh,yeah... Over there... *walks to other side of the room, where i was* ...much better. Now that i'm back where i was when i was there, i can write something interesting for you to read with your bodily reading utensils (eyes, mind etc.) Today's funky topics, suggested by folk from that bird-based, social-networking site are Creme eggs, Clockwork Robots and Toe-Jam. So in no particular order (easiest to splurge first) i'll start with Toe-Jam. Toe-Jam and Earl was a video game from the olden days, and was delightfully mental. I liked it at the time, but recently i played it and it was shit. There, that was one of them there video game nostalgic reviews that you can find anywhere on t'internet.

"visit to school Having been invited(to light the inaugural candle) to the first alumni meet of my school(where I lived from std VI to XII) I eventually made up mind to visit my school(St Basil's School, Basti).Time has always been the biggest inventor of the things, and it did so.There wan't a wall that did not get metamorphed!Right from the Principal's room to the overlooked things such as toilets had changed-changed for the better.A new building had been raised adjcent to the existing main building; and it served as boys hostel.The playground had faded rudiments of the cricket pitch(that used to shine vibrantly in our age).The grass did eat the pitch up thereby announcing that the new generation is no more a fanatic of Cricket, and a good basketball courts speaks of the interest of this generation.

There stood a permanent open stage right at the spot where we used to make temporary ones at each festive occasions(be it a youth festival, sports day, annual functions...).In our time we used be the labelled labours[taking benches out to the grounds, making stage by tying them together and bringing them back to the respective classrooms in the same order!]The permanent stage is a good substitute but I feel it had killed something! ;the joy of escaping from the class legally and doing an odd job between those cranky gossips while sweating badly under the torrid sun!

I opened a classroom labelled ""Std VII-A""(that infact used to be Std-XII 6 and a half years ago) and sat on the last but one bench of the middle row-my bench for it still bore my name that I carved with my 'divider(a geometry instrument)' on its right up corner.The handwriting is ofcourse bad when you try hard to represent yourself in the hard wood.A look at the black board made me remember of the faces that had taught me assortedly about this world.I could hear echoes of
Mr. James(our English Teacher) saying ""To be or not to be is the question..."" while he quoted intricacies of Hamlet's intellect,
Mr. Jaychandran(our teacher for Physics) saying ""...the euations of magnetic fields are similar to those of electric fields except for..."",
Mr. Jose explaining ""...the methodology of ion detection tests have been based on the solubility product..."", Mr. Sanjay while caressing his silky hairs ""find out the correlation for this distribution and verify..."" and so on and so forth.

Later I met with many of those faces; and I must admit that time did fail to change a few of them.Mrs Inan(our English Grammar teacher upto Class X) had exactly the same number of wrinkles she had seven years ago; Mr. Davis(our teacher for History upto Class X) was dressed in a shirt of same taste he had seven years ago;Who says you cannot travel back into the time!!

Then the friends, each of whom was already in some or the other flow of life(as decided by the individual destinies), with some antagoism disappeared while some mutual suspicion getting involuntarily introduced into the minds of the people who had seen each other after a long long break.

" No gay governor in South Carolina

They'd rather have the corrupt guy stay in power:
""We can't impeach for hypocrisy. We can't impeach for arrogance. We can't impeach an officeholder for his lack of leadership skills,"" said Rep. James Harrison, the Columbia Republican who headed the panel.
Can't impeach hypocrisy? Well, at least Andre Bauer is safe.

It may shock you to learn...


...that an anti-gay pol has been caught in a sex scandal:
Detective Bethany McDermott's affidavit says Jetton went to the woman's home around 9 p.m. Nov. 15 with two bottles of wine, which he allegedly opened alone in her kitchen. After drinking some of the wine and watching football, the statement said, the victim ""began ‘fading' in and out and remembered losing consciousness several times.""

The affidavit says Jetton and the alleged victim agreed on a safe word - ""green balloons"" - that could be used to stop sexual relations during the evening.
One of BlogActive's biggest fans pointed out that I should have included this snippet from an article in the Kansas City Star:
Instead, the affidavit says, Jetton hit her on the face and choked her before engaging in intercourse. Jetton allegedly said, ""You should have said 'green balloons,' before leaving her home the next morning.
Upodate 2: Good. He should pay a price. BREAKING: Jetton to close doors of consulting firm.

Charlie's Angels?


Florida governor’s child health recording directed callers to sex chat line:
In spite of government claims to the contrary, no horny girls are standing by to help your child get health insurance.

It's a state-sponsored blooper for the ages: for two months, a recording by Florida Governor Charlie Crist played when parents called KidCare to get advice on health policies for their children. In the audio, Crist gave a number to call for more information. As it happened, that number was a little off.

Instead of details on child health care, callers were redirected to this: 'Hey there, sexy guy. Welcome to an exciting new way to go live, one on one, with hot, horny girls waiting right now to talk to you.'"

"birth-day :)  Had a great b'day :) Got many surprises and many gifts :) Am utterly grateful to everyone who wished me today :) But a poem written by Arnav, a dear friend of mine stands out :)  My poem is about Siddharth....
What a sad start to this ode!!
Siddharth is....I'm mad
I'm taking the wrong road!!

I scratch my head and rack my brains
as I look to start this complimenting
but the right words just don't come out
now... Oh! that's the perfect starting

Words are less to describe this man
who downloads many a movie, makes many a plan.
He's devoted to AOL, smart on the street
enjoys blogging as well as many a tweet

His ambitions are unknown, but weaknesses are
His success could be rare, but knowledge spread far
messages are sweet & salty, SJ's are a pain
So he does to irritate, or for other's gain

Great is character, soft at heart
His friends are near but wide and far apart
The smile might not look good at all
But he's worthy to be friends with and give a call

On the day of birthday No. 21
I'd want him to enjoy, have loads of fun
No matter what he might do today
No one forgets the ""Siddharth Jain"" way

love,
Siddharth"

I checked the traffic ahead through the portion of the windshield of the auto which was not covered with Rajni stickers. I was precariously holding on to the dozen plastic bags full of cheap clothing accessories I had bought from Ranganathan Street. “Shit! The traffic is too heavy. I hate Chennai for this.”  As I completed the statement a truck moved close to the auto releasing sooty smoke into the cramped interior of the auto. I strained hard to close my nose with my palm without losing hold on any of the bags.  “Shall I hold some of them?” Sheela offered. I handed over a couple of bags, and checked her face in the rear view mirror of the auto. Beads of perspiration were flowing down her forehead, wetting the sandal in the center. But unlike my weary face, her countenance showed no signs of impatience or irritation.  “Do you need to go home urgently?”  “Not really. But this traffic and pollution is too much to bear.”  She kept looking out of the window at the passing vehicles like a foreign tourist admiring the ethnic beauty of the place.  I looked at the auto driver’s face on the rear view mirror and noted that he too was thoroughly irritated with the traffic and felt some solace for having someone equally irritated with the circumstances.  I turned to see if Sheela was done with admiring the traffic and realized she would never stop. I had met her in the T Nagar bus stop, waiting for a Besant Nagar bus just like me. After seeing the buses overly crowded, she asked if we could share an auto ride. “How is your new job?”  “Well, it is no longer new, but it is good. What about you? Did you … er…”  “Yeah… I got a job. I am a junior accountant at a financing firm.”  “Oh cool… I felt guilty the other day when you said you missed your interview.”  “Hey you don’t have to feel guilty. I might not have gotten selected after all. I don’t regret anything at all.” “It is rare to see someone who doesn’t regret anything.”

" Drunk Girls 

Yesterday the fine people at Red Stripe sent me a case of their finest imported Jamaican beer. So I brought it home, called my friend Andy, and invited him over to enjoy the lager before heading out to meet up with Brian for some Kareoke at Lolita Tavern. 

Andy came over with his med school friend Jared. We sat around drinking, smoking, and talking about the Olsen Twins. Jared's family is born-again Christian and I learned that he kept Kosher and celebrates Passover. Like me, he thinks that Hannukah isn't as important of a holiday as the media would like us to think. Whatever, the festival of lights was important, but in the grand scheme of things, the holiday gets more attention than it should because it falls in the same month of Christmas. I think that in my 23 years of living, I got about 3 gifts on Hannukah, and it was all coincedental because my mom just likes to shop. Last weekend she bought me a new comforter and Ralph Lauren sheets... but only because she loves to shop, not because she was posing as Hannukah Harry. 

Anyway... on to the important stuff: 
After the three of us had a few drinks we headed over to Lolita Tavern to meet up with Brian and participate in some Sid and Buddy Kareoke. [By the way, i think S&B will be hosting the Aquarius Birthday Kareoke Bash that i'm having with Laura and Dan -- everyone is invited, of course]. Good times as usual. Jared joined me on stage to sing ""Ziggy Stardust"" ... I tried to serenade a drunk girl who was passed out, but even my off-key singing didnt wake her. So everyone posed with her. 

Eventually I woke her up (which took a lot of shaking, prodding, etc), helped her up, and told her that she had to go. Andy brought her some water, she drank it and ran out. We tried to find her to put her in a taxi, but she literally disappeared into the night. Vanished.

Dear The Flu 

Dear The Flu, 
Thanks for coming just in time for the holiday party season. I know that you and God had to do it to prevent me from drinking too much and dying from alcohol posioning at the holiday party. That's cool. I can live with that. Instead I sat in bed thinking that all i needed were drops of zinc to cure me until I woke up on friday afternoon and texted Lizzy to come into my room to see if I had a fever since I couldn't move. Determining that I was burning up, she brought me some NyQuil and Orange Juice. Then Damon came over to give me Theraflu. At about 2am, Marc jumped into my bed and found me heating up and sweaty. The next morning I woke up healthy! See ya next year! 

Love, Sarah."

When I took a vacation last week around Europe a little bit, there was one thing that really hit me hard. How can I have bosses who wish more for my personal well being than whether I am of “good use” or not? Why am I saying this?  Mr. Boss 1 called to check if I was having a good time more than once during the last 10 days. Second, he gave me his car and also some good advice about why certain things happen certain ways (more spice to those who know it  ) and during the whole time never did we talk about work, or the deliverables that were on my plate (which I did manage to finish before leaving although not sure if he was aware of it). And when my CEO actually sent me a message saying, “enjoy your vacation…”, although I never really did a big bonanza with a project or anything before I actually took the vacation, it tells a lot about motivation and leadership. And I wonder how these guys can be who they are, be great personal friends and still be the whipping task masters if they want to. You guys at Result are simply too good to be true. Looking forward to do more cool things as always :)
